Dhu had been arrested two days earlier for unpaid fines, and was required to serve four days in custody to clear part of the debt. While detained, Dhu complained of pain and was taken to hospital. Police accused her of faking her condition, and medical staff believed her complaints were exaggerated and suspected drug withdrawal. Dhu died shortly after arriving on her third visit to hospital. The cause of death was an infection due to three-month-old rib fractures caused by her partner. An internal police investigation found 11 officers had not complied with regulations or were guilty of misconduct. A <a href=\"/wiki/Coroner\" title=\"Coroner\">coronial</a> inquest found that she suffered \"unprofessional and inhumane\" handling by police and \"deficient\" treatment from hospital staff. The inquest recommended not imprisoning people for unpaid fines and introducing a <a href=\"/wiki/Custody_Notification_Scheme\" title=\"Custody Notification Scheme\">Custody Notification Scheme</a>.

      "But all is not well within our so-called Urban Century. Rapid urbanization, rising gentrification, concentrated poverty, and shortages of basic infrastructure have combined to create spatial inequity in cities and suburbs across the globe. The challenges of housing, moving, and employing so many people have led to longer travel times, rising housing costs, and unsustainable public spending. Moreover, policymakers are questioning traditional policies and approaches.\n",
      "The past couple years, we’ve led a project at Brookings—Moving to Access—that responds to these spatial challenges by promoting the idea of connecting people to opportunities as a new foundational principle for 21st century urban development. This principle of accessibility is meant to be a corollary to the natural questions we ask ourselves everyday about the communities where we live: Is this the best location to access employment? Are there nearby schools and health services? Is there a market in the neighborhood? How can I get from here to there? Such choices are valid for those with sufficient income. But what about those with more limited resources and thus choices in terms of affordable housing and affordable transport?\n",
      "While economists, planners, and engineers have promoted accessibility for decades, the concept is more often found in textbooks than formal urban policies. In the first stage of this project, we worked with a team of experts to determine what has stalled practical implementation of appropriate policies and practices? “Delivering Inclusive Access,” a report of this initial work, offers a synthesis of what we found and where we believe researchers, policymakers, and practitioners can take this work next. The paper found three central challenges.\n",
      "The fallacy of the single indicator\n",
      "The current transport regime’s approach to measurement is one of outward elegance: The dominant pursuit is speed, and the primary way to measure it is congestion (or what slows us down). Many have come to label this approach a pursuit of “mobility.” It is seen through different, but often singular, measures of how congestion affects a specific roadway. Such singular measures are easily interpreted by policymakers and civil society and can be translated directly into economic analysis of related investments through timesavings. They also conveniently serve such purposes as the internationally agreed-upon Sustainable Development Goals. Yet they actually don’t answer the fundamental question of who can reach where, in how much time, and at what cost.\n",

      "Accessibility measures can answer those questions, but not through any one measure. First, the variable social, economic, and political contexts related to access mean searching for a single magical indicator is counterintuitive. For example, a wealthy, automobile-centric region like Dallas, Texas, may have very different measurable goals than a denser, poorer region like Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Second, academic literature is now rife with such complex measures that it could be difficult to communicate their methodology and results with practitioners. The development of a suite of indicators could offer a menu for policymakers and practitioners to judge accessibility based on local objectives, local conditions, and local capacity.\n",
      "The danger of excessive localization\n",
      "Decentralization and empowering local communities is fast becoming a mantra of governance experts across the world, from development practitioners at institutions like the World Bank to city-focused theorists. And for good reason: delegating policy design and fiscal authority directly to the local level helps ensure policies and practices respond to local needs and desires. Yet as urban areas spillover into contiguous and often numerous municipalities, local independence can introduce certain challenges, especially relating to social and environmental externalities. When it comes to transportation and land development, interests of one municipality are often different from its neighbors. And these divergent development goals can exacerbate accessibility challenges within growing regions, spreading people, housing jobs, and other activities further from one another.\n",
      "Addressing spatial inequities in land use and real estate markets require a broader approach to horizontal governance. While there are examples of metropolitan transport authorities, there is less willingness to consider metropolitan or horizontal governance of land use and fiscal policies. For example, should housing be coordinated across an entire region?\n",
      "Countries with a more centralized top down approach to governance, such as France and Germany, have greater ability to formulate metropolitan governance than more decentralized countries such as the U.S. This is not to say there is a one-size-fits-all approach, but there is an opportunity to test different solutions within different governance contexts, comparing how effective each model is to promote spatial inclusivity.\n",
      "The finance community is missing in action\n",
      "Financing is a central topic in infrastructure circles. As maintenance bills from the automobile era come due, populations continue to grow, and fiscal budgets are tight, how can urban areas afford to build enough infrastructure to support future economic growth? In response, new approaches are evolving in fiscal instruments, such as value capture and private-public partnerships. Missing in these discussions, however, are the implications for inclusive access.\n",
      "We conducted a multi-decade review of past academic literature on access and found that there is no clear substantive discussion of accessibility from a fiscal perspective. While urban transport and land use professionals clearly recognize their interrelationship in achieving inclusive accessibility, at least in theory, the fiscal and finance professionals generally ignore the implications of their instruments with regard to inclusivity. The multilateral development banks and their economic evaluations have ignored the distributive impacts until very recently. And the efforts of some countries to incorporate measures through multi-criteria analysis have had limited impact.\n",
      "This gap must be resolved in any effort toward inclusive urban development. There is little doubt that fiscal approaches must carefully assess who ultimately pays and that alternative finance instruments should be adapted to foster access for all.\n",
      "Going forward\n",
      "Our research confirms that there are enormous opportunities to advance accessibility theory into practice. At this point, what is desperately needed is to launch a range of case studies that deal with these issues and challenges under different geographic, governance, and economic contexts. The good news is that many initiatives are already underway, and more robust communication channels and technology can support such efforts. In Chicago, researchers created an online platform to visually explore accessibility by location. In Bogota, researchers evaluated how affordability is a key principle of access. And in Cairo and Kigali, researchers used open tools to achieve new insights for accessibility. Sharing the results of these case studies could lead to a new level of cross-disciplinary approaches to improve accessibility and lessen the effects of spatial inequity.\n",

While drawing on the principles that gird our economic and political systems to provide a well-rounded education, like law schools and business schools, policy schools provide professional training. They are quite distinct from graduate programs in political science or economics which aim to train the next generation of academics. As professional training programs, they add value by imparting both the skills which are relevant to current employers, and skills which we know will be relevant as organizations and societies evolve. \n",
      "The relevance of the skills that policy programs impart to address problems of today and tomorrow bears further discussion. We are living through an era in which societies are increasingly interconnected. The wide-scale adoption of devices such as the smartphone is having a profound impact on our culture, communities, and economy. The use of social and digital media and associated means of communication enabled by mobile devices is changing the tone, content, and geographic scope of our conversations, modifying how information is generated and consumed, and changing the very nature of citizen engagement. \n",
      "Information technology-based platforms provisioned by private providers such as Facebook, Google, Uber, and Lyft maintain information about millions of citizens and enable services such as transportation that were mediated in the past solely by the public sector. Surveillance for purposes of public safety via large-scale deployment of sensors also raises fundamental questions about information privacy. From technology-enabled global delivery of work to displacement and replacement of categories of work, some studies estimate that up to 47 percent of U.S. employment might be at risk of computerization with an attendant rise in income inequality. These technology-induced changes will affect every policy domain. How should policy programs best prepare students to address societal challenges in this world that is being transformed by technology? We believe the answer lies in educating students to be “men and women of intelligent action.” \n",
      "A model of policy education\n",
      "We begin with a skills-based model of policy education. These four essential skills address the general problems policy practitioners frequently face:\n",
      "\n",
      "Design skills to craft policy ideas \n",
      "Analytical skills to make smart ex ante decisions \n",
      "Interpersonal experience to manage policy implementation  \n",
      "Evaluative skills to assess outcomes ex post and correct course if necessary\n",
      "\n",
      "These skills make up the policy analysis toolkit required to be data driven practitioner of “intelligent action” in any policy domain. This toolkit needs to be supplemented by an understanding of how technology is transforming societal challenges, enabling new solutions, or disrupting existing regulatory regimes. This understanding is essential to policy formulation and implementation. \n",
      "Pillar 1: Design skills\n",
      "As with engineering, where design precedes analysis, this first pillar seeks to educate students in thinking creatively about problems in order to devise and develop policy ideas. Using ideas derived from design, divergent and convergent thinking principles are employed to generate, explore, and arrive at a candidate set of solutions. Using Uber as an example, an approach to identify and explore the key policy issues such as convenience, costs, driver working hours, and insurance would involve interviewing and observing both incumbent taxi drivers and Uber drivers. This in turn would lead to a set of alternatives that deserve further and careful consideration.  Using these skills, candidate designs and choices that are generated can be evaluated using the policy analytic toolkit. \n",
      "Pillar 2: Analytical skills\n",
      "At Carnegie Mellon, we are often cited in media and interrogated by peers on our approach to analytical and technology skills education. Curiosity about which skills are the “right” skills to teach policy practitioners are common, but we believe this is the wrong approach. We instead begin from the premise that policy or management decisions should be grounded in evidence.  We then determine the skills required to assemble the types of evidence that will likely be available to policy makers in the future.  In increasingly instrumented environments where citizens and infrastructure produce continuous streams of data, making sense of it all will require a somewhat different set of skills. We believe that a grounding in micro-economics, operations research, statistics, and program evaluation (aka causal inference) to be an essential core to policy programs. \n",
      "New coursework will teach students to work with multi-variable data and machine learning with an emphasis on prediction. This material ought to be part of the required coursework in statistics given the importance of prediction in many policy implementation settings. Along the same lines, the ability to work with unstructured data (especially text) and data visualization will become increasingly relevant to all students, not just those students who want to specialize in data analytics. Finally, knowledge of data manipulation and analysis languages such as Python and R for analytic work will be important because data often has to be massaged and cleansed prior to analysis. An important task for programs will be to determine the competencies expected of graduates. \n",
      "Pillar 3: Interpersonal experiences\n",
      "The third pillar of the skills-based model is interpersonal experience, where the practiced habits of good communication and steady negotiation developed with a sound understanding of organizations, their design and their behaviors. We label these purposely as experiences rather than skills because we believe they are best practiced either in the real-world or in simulated real-world settings. It is also in this pillar where practitioners learn the knowledge necessary to become credible experts in their domain. We believe that in addition to core coursework in the area, a supplementary curriculum which provides students with opportunities to gain these experiences is an essential component of our educational model.\n",

      "The ability to carefully diagnose the effectiveness of policy or management interventions is the fourth pillar of our model. It is insufficient to create and execute policy without measurement, and this is where both careful thought to the fundamental issues of measurement and evaluation become important. The ability to make objective judgments on the benefits, liabilities, and unintended consequences of prior policies is the goal of this set of skills. Here, sound statistical and econometric training with an understanding of the principles of causal inference is essential. In addition, program evaluation skills such as cost-benefit and financial analysis help practitioners round out their evaluation skills by considering both non-monetary and economic impacts.\n",
      "What should be retired?\n",
      "A skills-based approach might replace certain aspects of existing policy training.  This depends on a number of factors specific to each institution, but three generally applicable observations are clear. First, real-world experiences are a powerful way to encode domain learning as well as project management skills. Through project-based work, students can learn about institutional contexts in specific policy domains and political processes such as budgeting. Second, team-based projects allow students to learn and apply principles of management and organizational behavior. At Carnegie Mellon, we refer to these as “systems synthesis” projects, since they require students to adopt a systemic point of view and to synthesize a number of skills in their policy analysis toolkit. Third, interpersonal skills training can be practiced through activities such as weekend negotiation exercises, hackathons, and speaker series. These activities can be highly intentional and fashioned to reinforce skills rather than as a recess from the “real work” of classroom training. Since students complete graduate programs in such a short time, counseling them to focus on outcomes from day one will allow them to choose a reinforcing set of coursework and real-world experiences. \n",
      "In summary, we argue for a model of policy education that views practitioners as future problem solvers. Good policy education must consider the ways in which problems will present themselves, and the ways in which answers will obscure themselves. Rigorous training grounded in the analysis of available evidence and buoyed by real-world interpersonal experiences is a sound approach to relevant, durable policy training.\n",

      "For decades, we have been hearing that the baby-boom generation was like a pig moving through a python–bigger than the generations before and after. \n",
      "That’s true. But that’s also a very misleading metaphor for understanding the demographic forces that are driving up federal spending: They aren’t temporary. The generation born between 1946 and 1964 is the beginning of a demographic transition that will persist for decades after the baby boomers die, the consequence of lengthening lifespans and declining fertility. Putting the federal budget on a sustainable course requires long-lasting fixes, not short-lived tweaks.  \n",
      "First, a few demographic facts.\n",
      "As the chart below illustrates, there was a surge in births in the U.S. at the end of World War II, a subsequent decline, and then an uptick as baby boomers began having children.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the population has been rising, the number of births in the U.S. the past few years has been below the peak baby-boom levels, possibly because many couples chose not to have children during bad economic times. More significant, fertility rates–roughly the number of babies born per woman during her lifetime–have fallen well below pre-baby-boom levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Americans are living longer. In 1950, a man who made it to age 65 could expect to live until 78 and a woman until 81. Social Security’s actuaries project that a man who lived to age 65 in 2010 will reach 84 and a woman age 86.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Put all this together, and it’s clear that a growing fraction of the U.S. population will be 65 or older.   \n",

      "According to President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), approximately 3.1 million jobs will be rendered obsolete or permanently altered as a consequence of artificial intelligence technologies. Artificial intelligence (AI) will, for the foreseeable future, have a significant disruptive impact on jobs. That said, this disruption can create new opportunities if policymakers choose to harness them—including some with the potential to help address long-standing social inequities. Investing in quality training programs that deliver premium skills, such as computational analysis and cognitive thinking, provides a real opportunity to leverage AI’s disruptive power.\n",

      "AI’s disruption presents a clear challenge: competition to traditional skilled workers arising from the cross-relevance of data scientists and code engineers, who can adapt quickly to new contexts. Data analytics has become an indispensable feature of successful companies across all industries. This reality dictates that companies invest heavily in data analytics to remain competitive and profitable. Consequently, unlikely industries such as retail, banking, finance, and even agricultural firms are aggressively competing for talent with specific computational data science and programming skills. A recent IBM report expertly quantifies the scope and breadth of employers’ hiring demands, noting that “[d]emand for data-driven decision makers, such as data-enabled marketing managers, will comprise one-third of the data savvy professional job market, with a projected increase of 110,000 positions by 2020.” Herein lies a window of opportunity: the rapidly growing technical skills gap.\n",
      "Investing in high-quality education and training programs is one way that policymakers proactively attempt to address the workforce challenges presented by artificial intelligence. It is essential that we make affirmative, inclusive choices to ensure that marginalized communities participate equitably in these opportunities.\n",
      "Policymakers should prioritize understanding the demographics of those most likely to lose jobs in the short-run. As opposed to obsessively assembling case studies, we need to proactively identify policy entrepreneurs who can conceive of training policies that equip workers with technical skills of “long-game” relevance. As IBM points out, “[d]ata democratization impacts every career path, so academia must strive to make data literacy an option, if not a requirement, for every student in any field of study.”\n",
      "Machines are an equal opportunity displacer, blind to color and socioeconomic status.\n",
      "Machines are an equal opportunity displacer, blind to color and socioeconomic status. Effective policy responses require collaborative data collection and coordination among key stakeholders—policymakers, employers, and educational institutions—to  identify at-risk worker groups and to inform workforce development strategies. Machine substitution is purely an efficiency game in which workers overwhelmingly lose. Nevertheless, we can blunt these effects by identifying critical leverage points.\n",
      "Investing in innovative education and training is an excellent place to start. Bill Gates’ recent $1.7 billion investment in U.S. public schools is a sign of the way forward, which offers two compelling messages for policymakers. First, innovate and experiment until we identify the right policies. Second, prioritize high-needs schools in poor neighborhoods; they deserve distinct attention to close their opportunity gaps and prepare them to be competitive in the future workforce.\n",
      "Policymakers can choose to harness AI’s disruptive power to address workforce challenges and redesign fair access to opportunity simultaneously. We should train our collective energies on identifying practical policies that update our current agrarian-based education model, which unfairly disadvantages children from economically segregated neighborhoods. Evidence from a Harvard and New York University research study suggests attending a high-quality high school increases a student’s chances of attending a four-year college; which by extension improves their future income earning potential.\n",
      "Let me ask a bold question: how much do we lose if we experiment with substituting an entry-level data science class for machine shop or a vocational carpentry program in urban high schools and community colleges? A 2010 pilot partnership between the University of California, Los Angeles and the National Science Foundation is an encouraging sign; the pilot focuses on redesigning computer science curricula in urban high schools to include newer mobile technologies and computational analysis.\n",

There are many partial explanations for this—local cost of living, differences in education levels, experience, and industry—but none of them quite account for it. It turns out that developers living in San Jose have acquired the specific skills most valued by employers.\n",

      "As the map below shows, there is a huge amount of variation in earnings for software application developers across regional labor markets. In large metropolitan areas like New York, they earn $105,000, but in Louisville, they earn just $72,000.\n",

      "The surprising thing, when it comes to software developers and other skilled occupations too, is that none of these factors can fully account for the San Jose premium. Software developers in San Jose are typically slightly less experienced, and while their levels of education are higher—including their likelihood of having majored in engineering or computer science—the difference is not enough to explain their elevated earnings. Likewise, the cost of living in San Jose is remarkably high, but comparable to other major cities. \n",

Of these, roughly 1.4 million were for software application developers, making it the most in-demand occupation. In total, 3 million ads also contained salary information, which I could use to estimate the average value of each distinct skill advertised. \n",

      " \n",
      "For example, 8.4 percent of ads for software developers in San Jose requested Java, a widely used programming language, associated with an average salary of $98,000 across all U.S. ads mentioning both it and a salary requirement. Yet, for the United States as a whole, just 5.7 percent of software developer ads required Java. In New York City, the share was 6.7, and it was 4.7 in Louisville.\n",
      " \n",
      "Other high-value programming languages and skills were disproportionately advertised in San Jose, such as Linux, C++, Python and the term “software engineering.”  These skills were much less commonly required for jobs in Louisville and even New York. Only 0.2 percent of software jobs required Python in Louisville and 1.7 in New York City, compared to 2.8 percent in San Jose. It is valued at $100,345.\n",

      "Public policy and public affairs schools aim to train competent creators and implementers of government policy. While drawing on the principles that gird our economic and political systems to provide a well-rounded education, like law schools and business schools, policy schools provide professional training. They are quite distinct from graduate programs in political science or economics which aim to train the next generation of academics. As professional training programs, they add value by imparting both the skills which are relevant to current employers, and skills which we know will be relevant as organizations and societies evolve. \n",
      "The relevance of the skills that policy programs impart to address problems of today and tomorrow bears further discussion. We are living through an era in which societies are increasingly interconnected. The wide-scale adoption of devices such as the smartphone is having a profound impact on our culture, communities, and economy. The use of social and digital media and associated means of communication enabled by mobile devices is changing the tone, content, and geographic scope of our conversations, modifying how information is generated and consumed, and changing the very nature of citizen engagement. \n",
      "Information technology-based platforms provisioned by private providers such as Facebook, Google, Uber, and Lyft maintain information about millions of citizens and enable services such as transportation that were mediated in the past solely by the public sector. Surveillance for purposes of public safety via large-scale deployment of sensors also raises fundamental questions about information privacy. From technology-enabled global delivery of work to displacement and replacement of categories of work, some studies estimate that up to 47 percent of U.S. employment might be at risk of computerization with an attendant rise in income inequality. These technology-induced changes will affect every policy domain. How should policy programs best prepare students to address societal challenges in this world that is being transformed by technology? We believe the answer lies in educating students to be “men and women of intelligent action.” \n",
      "A model of policy education\n",
      "We begin with a skills-based model of policy education. These four essential skills address the general problems policy practitioners frequently face:\n",
      "\n",
      "Design skills to craft policy ideas \n",
      "Analytical skills to make smart ex ante decisions \n",
      "Interpersonal experience to manage policy implementation  \n",
      "Evaluative skills to assess outcomes ex post and correct course if necessary\n",
      "\n",
      "These skills make up the policy analysis toolkit required to be data driven practitioner of “intelligent action” in any policy domain. This toolkit needs to be supplemented by an understanding of how technology is transforming societal challenges, enabling new solutions, or disrupting existing regulatory regimes. This understanding is essential to policy formulation and implementation. \n",
      "Pillar 1: Design skills\n",
      "As with engineering, where design precedes analysis, this first pillar seeks to educate students in thinking creatively about problems in order to devise and develop policy ideas. Using ideas derived from design, divergent and convergent thinking principles are employed to generate, explore, and arrive at a candidate set of solutions. Using Uber as an example, an approach to identify and explore the key policy issues such as convenience, costs, driver working hours, and insurance would involve interviewing and observing both incumbent taxi drivers and Uber drivers. This in turn would lead to a set of alternatives that deserve further and careful consideration.  Using these skills, candidate designs and choices that are generated can be evaluated using the policy analytic toolkit. \n",
      "Pillar 2: Analytical skills\n",
      "At Carnegie Mellon, we are often cited in media and interrogated by peers on our approach to analytical and technology skills education. Curiosity about which skills are the “right” skills to teach policy practitioners are common, but we believe this is the wrong approach. We instead begin from the premise that policy or management decisions should be grounded in evidence.  We then determine the skills required to assemble the types of evidence that will likely be available to policy makers in the future.  In increasingly instrumented environments where citizens and infrastructure produce continuous streams of data, making sense of it all will require a somewhat different set of skills. We believe that a grounding in micro-economics, operations research, statistics, and program evaluation (aka causal inference) to be an essential core to policy programs. \n",
      "New coursework will teach students to work with multi-variable data and machine learning with an emphasis on prediction. This material ought to be part of the required coursework in statistics given the importance of prediction in many policy implementation settings. Along the same lines, the ability to work with unstructured data (especially text) and data visualization will become increasingly relevant to all students, not just those students who want to specialize in data analytics. Finally, knowledge of data manipulation and analysis languages such as Python and R for analytic work will be important because data often has to be massaged and cleansed prior to analysis. An important task for programs will be to determine the competencies expected of graduates. \n",
      "Pillar 3: Interpersonal experiences\n",
      "The third pillar of the skills-based model is interpersonal experience, where the practiced habits of good communication and steady negotiation developed with a sound understanding of organizations, their design and their behaviors. We label these purposely as experiences rather than skills because we believe they are best practiced either in the real-world or in simulated real-world settings. It is also in this pillar where practitioners learn the knowledge necessary to become credible experts in their domain. We believe that in addition to core coursework in the area, a supplementary curriculum which provides students with opportunities to gain these experiences is an essential component of our educational model.\n",

      "The ability to carefully diagnose the effectiveness of policy or management interventions is the fourth pillar of our model. It is insufficient to create and execute policy without measurement, and this is where both careful thought to the fundamental issues of measurement and evaluation become important. The ability to make objective judgments on the benefits, liabilities, and unintended consequences of prior policies is the goal of this set of skills. Here, sound statistical and econometric training with an understanding of the principles of causal inference is essential. In addition, program evaluation skills such as cost-benefit and financial analysis help practitioners round out their evaluation skills by considering both non-monetary and economic impacts.\n",
      "What should be retired?\n",
      "A skills-based approach might replace certain aspects of existing policy training.  This depends on a number of factors specific to each institution, but three generally applicable observations are clear. First, real-world experiences are a powerful way to encode domain learning as well as project management skills. Through project-based work, students can learn about institutional contexts in specific policy domains and political processes such as budgeting. Second, team-based projects allow students to learn and apply principles of management and organizational behavior. At Carnegie Mellon, we refer to these as “systems synthesis” projects, since they require students to adopt a systemic point of view and to synthesize a number of skills in their policy analysis toolkit. Third, interpersonal skills training can be practiced through activities such as weekend negotiation exercises, hackathons, and speaker series. These activities can be highly intentional and fashioned to reinforce skills rather than as a recess from the “real work” of classroom training. Since students complete graduate programs in such a short time, counseling them to focus on outcomes from day one will allow them to choose a reinforcing set of coursework and real-world experiences. \n",
      "In summary, we argue for a model of policy education that views practitioners as future problem solvers. Good policy education must consider the ways in which problems will present themselves, and the ways in which answers will obscure themselves. Rigorous training grounded in the analysis of available evidence and buoyed by real-world interpersonal experiences is a sound approach to relevant, durable policy training.\n",

      "Amidst growing frustration with the cost of higher education, complaints also abound about its quality. One critique, launched in the book Academically Adrift by two sociologists, finds little evidence that college students score better on measures of critical thinking, writing, and reasoning after attending college. This is something of a paradox, since strong evidence shows that attending college tends to raise earnings power, even for students who start with mediocre preparation. \n",
      "Our recent study uses a different approach to assess the value of a college education. We find that the particular skills listed by a college’s alumni on their resumes predict how well graduates from those schools perform in terms of earning a living, meeting debt obligations, and working for high-paying or innovative companies. Since jobs requiring more valuable skills typically require at least some college education, this finding suggests many students are gaining valuable skills from college. But the variation in alumni skills across schools is wide, even after considering the aptitude of the students in terms of their pre-admission test scores. This variation implies that what one studies and where have big effects on economic outcomes.\n",

      "\n",
      "It is widely known that education raises individual earnings, but education—measured in years of study or level of degree—is a very rough measure of learning. Thus, it is not surprising that studies consistently find that skills are an important predictor of economic outcomes. People with higher test scores—another measure of learning—earn higher wages, even with the same level of education. Likewise, graduates with technical degrees earn more, as do workers in occupations requiring more STEM skills. At the international scale, performance on standardized exams has a much stronger statistical relationship with economic outcomes than do years of education, according to a new OECD study.\n",

      "Using data from the company Burning Glass, we calculated the average salary listed for distinct skills based on 3 million job vacancy ads. To match these skills to colleges, we used data from LinkedIn’s college profile pages, which show the 25 most common skills (e.g., customer service, Microsoft Excel, Python) listed by alumni from each college. For the average college, we observed 1,150 profiles per skill. (A great advantage of using LinkedIn data is the large sample size.) We obtained data for 2,164 colleges representing profiles for 2.5 million U.S. residents who attended college. By comparison, Academically Adrift surveyed 2,300 college graduates.\n",

      "Measured at mid-career (meaning at least 10 years of working), salaries tend to be much higher for alumni who list high-value skills on their resumes. Earnings go up by an average of $2,600 for every decile of skill. Our more detailed empirical work shows that skills predict higher earnings even after controlling for math test scores on the ACT and SAT, as well as other student characteristics like family income.\n",
      "Cal Tech graduates list the highest-value skills (e.g., Matlab, Python, C++, algorithms, and machine learning) and typically earn $126,000 at mid-career. Other four-year schools with high-value skills and high salaries include Harvey Mudd, MIT, the Polytechnic Institute of New York University, and the Air Force Academy. \n",
      "Earnings data from two-year colleges are not as widely available, and the correlation with alumni skills is weaker, but alumni from those schools also seem to benefit from higher skills training. Top schools include the Pittsburg Institute of Aeronautics, Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology (Tulsa, Okla.), Coleman University (San Diego), Hondros College (Columbus, Ohio), and SUNY College of Technology at Alfred.\n",

Here too, more valuable skills translate into labor market success. For example, not a single Harvey Mudd attendee between 2009 and 2011 defaulted on his or her federal loans within three years of leaving. Repayment rates average 95 percent for four-year colleges in the top 10 percent for alumni skills but 87 percent for those in the bottom 10 percent.

A total of 212 employers, including government agencies, made it onto a top 100 list for at least one group of student majors.

      "Earnings and other economic outcomes should not be equated with social value, and there are plenty of jobs and professions—child care, teaching, social work—that pay modestly but are nevertheless highly valuable to society. Colleges that specialize in this training or instill even moderately valuable skills in the least academically prepared students may be socially important institutions even if their alumni frequently are less affluent.\n",
      "Nonetheless, earnings clearly matter privately and socially, as does work that supports innovation and highly productive advanced industries. Many colleges offer programs of study in fields that appear to have almost no market value—nor even any social value since the knowledge acquired is never put to use, at least through paid employment. In this sense, how well colleges instill highly valuable skills and prepare students to contribute productively to the economy should be an important consideration when evaluating schools. Colleges that do this for the students least likely to otherwise succeed are offering an even more beneficial service, as we have discussed in our value-added college research.\n",

      "BODY:\n",
      "\n",
      "While the world is fixated on Iraq and the Middle East, North Korea continues to pose at least as great a threat to Western security interests. Six-party talks with the North Koreans in Beijing have just showed that the Bush administration hasn’t yet found a way out of the nuclear crisis. Although negotiations appear likely to resume in a couple of months, their prospects for success seem poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The basic dilemma is easy to understand. North Korea will not surrender its nuclear capabilities, which are among its only valuable national assets, unless offered a very good deal for giving them up. President Bush refuses to offer such a deal because he sees the North Korean demand as blackmail. He insists that before any talks about better diplomatic relations or economic interaction occur, North Korea first relinquish—with verification—a nuclear program it had pledged nine years ago to abandon completely. At most, Bush may, as an interim gesture, offer to sign a multilateral accord in which all six parties (the two Koreas, the United States, China, Japan and Russia) pledge not to attack each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, in fits and starts North Korea continues its gradual progress toward a larger nuclear capability. Given the regime’s desperate economic straits, its erratic and eccentric and isolated regime and its threats last April that it might even export nuclear materials if circumstances got bad enough, this is extremely bad news.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the extent the Bush administration has a plan for addressing this crisis, it is a strategy of pressure. It insisted on the six-party negotiating format because that allows the other five parties all to insist that North Korea de-nuclearize. That kind of setting also deprives North Korea of its bluster and brinkmanship tactics.\n",

      "For example, when the delegation from Pyongyang used the recent Beijing meeting to accuse the Bush administration of harboring aggressive designs on North Korea, Russia countered that it was confident the United States had no such intention. The Bush administration also has established a creative concept known as the proliferation security initiative, by which countries such as the United States, Japan, Australia, France and Germany make use of existing national laws to inspect North Korean ships in their waters—complicating North Korea’s efforts to smuggle illicit weapons, drugs and counterfeit currency.\n",

      "\n",
      "Faced with this dilemma, we need to think bigger. We must offer much more to North Korea but demand far more in return. The goal should be to push North Korea, which has shown increasing interest in economic reform, to seriously attempt such reform—building on the precedents offered by China and Vietnam in the past two decades. If North Korea is willing and takes steps, such as cutting its conventional military forces, that are needed to give such a plan any hope of success, we can be generous in return. This would not be giving in to blackmail; it would be a form of assisted suicide for the Stalinist ways of the North Korean regime. Even if Kim Jong Il and his cronies survived the transition, their rule would be radically transformed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This plan would require the help of all six parties that are now part of the negotiating process. Chinese economists and technicians would teach the North Koreans how to carry out market reforms. Russia would reassure Kim Jong Il and his military commanders that intrusive arms control verification can be done without opening up the country to attack. Japan and South Korea would provide aid and investment; South Korea would also have to make at least modest cuts in its conventional forces in return for much deeper cuts in the oversized North Korean military.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the nuclear and conventional military issues, North Korea would also agree to verifiable elimination of its chemical weapons and ballistic missiles. It would cease counterfeiting and drug trafficking. It would have to let all Japanese kidnapping victims leave and begin a human rights dialogue with the outside world. It would continue to abstain from terrorism and provocative actions against its neighbors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States would, for its part, ease trade sanctions immediately and ultimately lift them. It would, together with its regional partners and international financial institutions, provide at least $2 billion a year in aid to North Korea. The aid would not be in the form of cash (or new nuclear reactors), and would not be provided in one big dose but would be disbursed incrementally—while we watched to make sure North Korea was also holding up its end of the grand bargain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diplomatic ties and security assurances leading to a full peace treaty would also be appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, this approach might well fail. North Korean leaders may, for example, believe they need nuclear weapons to deter the Bush administration from another preemptive action against another charter member of the axis of evil. But it would be a major mistake to act on that assumption before testing it. And if we try and fail, coercive policies may then become possible, as our regional partners will have a much harder time claiming that diplomacy has not yet been seriously attempted.\n",

      "America’s urban landscape is changing. The familiar distinctions between central cities and suburbs and between the growing Sunbelt and the more stagnant Frostbelt parts of the country are being complicated by new demographic trends, two in particular. The first trend is the sharp rise in immigration to the United States. Each year about one million people, predominantly Latin American and Asian in origin, arrive in the United States, most settling in urban areas. The second trend involves the baby-boomers. This large cohort of 76 million people?often termed “the pig in the python”?is now aging toward the tail of that python. Most boomers will not move but “age in place”?in the suburbs rather than in the city. Both these trends will have important effects on urban America.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the “White-Black, City-Suburb” Typology \n",
      "For much of the postwar period, discussions of race and space in urban America revolved around black migration to central cities and “white flight” to the suburbs. The new immigration that is infusing many urban areas with new residents from a variety of backgrounds suggests the need for a new way of thinking about the demographic profiles of cities and suburbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impact of immigration is apparent from a glance at the central counties (those that contain a metropolitan area’s central-city population) showing greatest population gains during 1990?99. The two largest gainers, Maricopa County, home of Phoenix, and Clark County, home of Las Vegas, achieved most of their gains from domestic migration?migrants from other parts of the United States. Yet each of the next five central counties with the greatest population gains?those of the Los Angeles, Houston, San Diego, Miami, and Dallas metropolitan areas?registered a net loss of domestic migrants. Their gains came entirely from international migration and natural increase. Were it not for immigration, the population of these areas, and of several other large central counties, would register far smaller growth or outright declines. Indeed, areas that do not attract nearly as many immigrants?the central counties of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Cleveland, and Buffalo, among others?lost population over the 1990s.\n",

      "The typology begins with a Multiethnic High Immigration category of 12 metropolitan areas with high immigration and a significant Asian or Hispanic presence. The largest of these areas are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco. Four other categories cover areas that have a primarily black minority presence and those that are mostly white; and within each, those growing at a relatively high pace and those growing only modestly. These four categories are: White-Black Fast-Growing (for example, Atlanta), White-Black Slow-Growing (Detroit), Mostly White Fast-Growing (Las Vegas), and Mostly White Slow-Growing (Pittsburgh).\n",

Mostly White Fast-Growing areas are located primarily in the West and Midwest (Orlando, Nashville, and West Palm Beach excepted).

      "Table 2 gives the composite racial profiles for cities and suburbs in each of these five categories. Multiethnic High Immigration areas clearly have the greatest diversity both in their cities and in their suburbs although the suburbs remain majority white. Among the White-Black categories, the slow-growing areas show a lesser tendency toward black suburbanization.\n",
      "\n",
      "What these statistics show is that the conventional view of cities as being in decline and as having predominantly black populations fails to take into account recent changes in the urban scene. Today some of the nation’s fastest-growing cities are gaining population from domestic migration and are mostly white. And several large multiethnic metropolitan areas house “majority minorities” in their cities and may soon do so in their suburbs as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old “city-suburb” typology also fails to recognize heterogeneous growth patterns within the suburbs. Many inner and even middle suburbs are experiencing demographic dynamics similar to those of the cities. This is especially the case in some of the largest “melting pot” metropolitan areas. A look at the immigration and domestic migration dynamics for counties within the greater Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York CMSAs (Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas) shows that it is not just the inner counties whose gains are attributable solely to international migration. Of the 29 counties in the greater New York CMSA, fully 20 registered negative domestic migration during 1990?99 and achieved their only migration growth from immigration from abroad. The same goes for 4 of the 5 counties in the Los Angeles CMSA and for 7 of the 10 counties of the San Francisco CMSA.\n",
      "\n",
      "The heterogeneity of suburbs was already apparent in 1990. Figure 1 compares the Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Detroit metropolitan areas. The racially diverse suburbs of Los Angeles, with their infusion of immigrants and new ethnic minorities, contrast with the suburbs of Atlanta, which show moderate racial heterogeneity, and those of slower-growing Detroit, where historical racial antagonisms keep the divide between city and suburbs fairly sharp.\n",

      "Suburban growth patterns continue to favor the outer suburbs. Of the 30 counties that made the fastest gains via net domestic migration during 1990?99, most that are in metropolitan areas lie in the outer suburban reaches of fast-growing metropolitan areas such as Denver, Atlanta, Las Vegas, Dallas, and Houston. Even in the fast-growing, less dense portions of the country, an outer suburban residence remains popular.\n",
      "Aging Boomers, Cities, and Suburbs\n",
      "Since the baby-boom generation began entering grade school in the 1950s, it has been followed closely by marketers, policymakers, and political consultants. But the boomers’ sharp disengagement from the residential aspects of city life seems to have escaped the notice of urban watchers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aging of the nation’s first suburban generation will increase substantially the number of households in their 50s and early 60s over the next 10 years. Early boomers?born between 1945 and 1955?will be making the transition from empty-nesters to preretirees. Many will retire from regular jobs. Some will leave their suburban homes. But most will “age in place” or perhaps make a local move.\n",
      "\n",
      "The late boomers?those born between 1955 and 1964?will still be in their prime career and prime earnings ages. Some will be looking to upgrade their housing, again in the same local area. They will have fewer children living at home than did earlier generations at the same age?and therefore more freedom in their location decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some observers have expressed the hope that these huge boomer generations might be a source for central-city revival. But the hope seems unrealistic, given the current location of this “suburban generation.” With the exception of Hispanics, baby-boomers, now in the 35-54 age groups, are less likely to reside in the city than either today’s elderly or adults now in their 20s and early 30s.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, elderly growth patterns during the 1990s show that the “graying of the suburbs” is well under way. Of the 30 counties with fastest-gaining elderly populations over the 1990s, most are either in nonmetropolitan areas or in middle or outer suburban counties of fast-growing metropolitan areas. Much of this simply reflects the aging-in-place of elderly who have moved to these fast-growing metropolitan areas during their lifetimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The projected gains in elderly over the next 25 years will occur in the Mostly White Fast-Growing and White-Black Fast-Growing areas discussed earlier. While some of this growth will be attributable to retirement migration to high amenity areas of the Mountain West and South, most will result from the aging-in-place of boomers who relocated there during their working lives or at least before retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "This suggests somewhat different patterns of growth for the new immigrant minorities than for largely white or white and black baby-boomers. Much of the boomer growth and, hence, the projected elderly gains will be in the suburbs of major metropolitan areas and in regions of the country that are not capturing new immigrant minorities. Within metropolitan areas the better-off and healthy “yuppie elderly” will tend to locate on the periphery, and the more disadvantaged segments of the older population will reside closer in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Central cities and inner suburbs in metropolitan regions that have suffered economic and demographic declines in recent decades will continue to house disproportionate numbers of the nation’s disadvantaged elderly?older elderly people, widows and widowers, female-headed households, those with incomes below or near the poverty level and relatively high levels of disability. As they continue to age in place, they will pose special challenges for local institutions that are often the most financially strapped.\n",
      "\n",
      "But although the aging of the baby-boomers will have different effects for cities and suburbs, dealing with the social services, health care, and transportation needs of a faster-growing senior population will prove a challenge to cities and suburbs alike.\n",
      "New Forces at Work\n",
      "The advent of new immigrants and the aging of the baby-boomers will surely complicate both urban and suburban race-ethnic and aging demographic dynamics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The demographics of Los Angeles provide just one example of how the two countervailing trends could operate. As a result of the successive outmigration of whites, juxtaposed with the continued waves of immigration of new ethnic minorities, Los Angeles County’s elderly population is still majority white, its working-aged population is only about one-third white, and its child population is predominantly Hispanic and other racial and ethnic groups. Reflecting their age, the growing racial and ethnic groups in Los Angeles will be concerned with issues of affordable housing, good schools, and neighborhoods conducive to the raising of children. And, reflecting their age, whites are likely to be more concerned with health and social support services for an aging dependent population. Whether the same kind of “racial generation gap” will occur in other melting pot metropolitan areas remains to be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever else the new urban population profiles show, the old models of dealing with cities and suburbs will need to be revised to adapt to new demographic forces in America today.\n",

      "BODY:\n",
      "\n",
      "America’s community colleges offer the promise of a more affordable pathway to a bachelor’s degree. Students can pay substantially less for the first two years of college, transfer to a four-year college or university, and still earn their diploma in the same amount of time. At least in theory. Most community college students—80 percent of them—enter with the intention to transfer, but only 20 percent actually do so within five years of entering college. This divide represents a classic case of what behavioralists call an intention-action gap. \n",
      "Why would so many students who enter community colleges intending to transfer fail to actually do so? Put yourself in the shoes of a 20-something community college student. You’ve worked hard for the past couple years, earning credits and paying a lot less in tuition than you would have if you had enrolled immediately in a four-year college or university. But now you want to transfer, so that you can complete your bachelor’s degree. How do you figure out where to go? Ideally you’d probably like to find a college that would take most of your credits, where you’re likely to graduate from, and where the degree is going to count for something in the labor market. A college advisor could probably help you figure this out, but at many community colleges there are at least 1,000 other students assigned to your advisor, so you might have a hard time getting a quality meeting.  Some states have articulation agreements between two- and four-year institutions that guarantee admission for students who complete certain course sequences and perform at a high enough level. But these agreements are often dense and inaccessible. \n",
      "The combination of big data and behavioral insights has the potential to help students navigate these complex decisions and successfully follow through on their intentions. Big data analytic techniques allow us to identify concrete transfer pathways where students are positioned to succeed; behavioral insights ensure we communicate these options in a way that maximizes students’ engagement and responsiveness. \n",
      "The transfer decision is of course only one of many such challenges students and families face in education, where information to help people make informed choices is theoretically available, but often complex and poorly communicated. Parents of toddlers in many states can now access early childcare rating information through Quality Rating Improvement Systems, but in most locations these systems have low visibility. High school students in many schools have a range of courses available to them, but they may not get sufficient counseling on which course sequences best position them for postsecondary education. \n",
      "A growing body of innovative research has demonstrated that, by applying behavioral science insights to the way we communicate with students and families about the opportunities and resources available to them, we can help people navigate these complex decisions and experience better outcomes as a result. A combination of simplified information, reminders, and access to assistance have improved achievement and attainment up and down the education pipeline, nudging parents to practice early-literacy activities with their kids or check in with their high schoolers about missed assignments, and encouraging students to renew their financial aid for college. \n",
      "Big data analytic techniques have the potential to contribute to a next generation of behavioral science interventions in education—strategies that help people overcome complex matching problems like the transfer decision by giving personalized information about educational pathways that both build on the students’ prior experience and best position them for future success. Think of this as Netflix’s movie recommendation algorithm applied to education. There have already been some initial ventures in this direction. In one seminal study, researchers capitalized on student-level academic achievement data from the College Board and publicly-available data on college characteristics to send high-achieving, low-income students semi-customized packets of high-quality colleges and universities where students had a good chance of being admitted based on their academic performance. But there’s also real potential for much greater personalization. \n",
      "Take a community college student’s transfer decision as an example. Working with a state higher education system, researchers and data scientists could use a combination of articulation agreements and data from prior cohorts of students to identify optimal transfer pathways for different student groups and course-taking histories. Using data on current students’ course-taking experiences and contact information they provide to their college, the system could proactively send students messages that identifies specific institutions where they have already met the transfer requirements, or where they are on track to do so, and where prior cohorts of students from their same college have been successful upon transferring. Behavioral scientists can help design this outreach in a way that maximizes student engagement and responsiveness.  \n",
      "These types of big data techniques are already being used in some education sectors. For instance, a growing number of colleges use predictive analytics to identify struggling students who need additional assistance, so faculty and administrators can intervene before the student drops out. But frequently there is insufficient attention, once the results of these predictive analyses are in hand, about how to communicate the information in a way that is likely to lead to behavior change among students or educators. And much of the predictive analytics work has been on the side of plugging leaks in the pipeline (e.g. preventing drop-outs from higher education), rather than on the side of proactively sending students and families personalized information about educational and career pathways where they are likely to flourish. \n",
      "From pre-K through college, students and families have to navigate one complex decision after another—about which schools to attend, what courses to take, which programs to apply for. These decisions are particularly daunting for socioeconomically-disadvantaged families who have less experience navigating complicated educational decisions and less access to professional advising. Families like these also have to devote a substantial portion of their cognitive bandwidth to just making ends meet financially. By leveraging big data techniques and behavioral science insights, we can help families identify educational opportunities that position them for ongoing success. \n",

      "“On this International Day, I urge commitment to end bias, greater investments in science, technology, engineering and math education for all women and girls as well as opportunities for their careers and longer-term professional advancement so that all can benefit from their ground-breaking future contributions.” — UN Secretary-General António Guterres\n",
      "Three years ago, the UN proclaimed February 11 the International Day of Women and Girls in Science. This new designation was part of a larger effort toward closing gender gaps around the globe, as outline in the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Though more women are pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), it is clear that gender gaps in these fields—and harmful biases– persist today.\n",
      "Highlighted below are charts and commentary from Brookings experts on the state of gender equity in STEM fields, and the obstacles that women and girls still face.\n",
      "U.S. WOMEN EARN MORE COLLEGE DEGREES THAN MEN OVERALL, BUT EARN A MINORITY OF UNDERGRADUATE DEGREES ISSUED IN STEM FIELDS\n",
      "In their study of gender disparities in education and employment, Ana Maria Munoz-Boudet and Ana Revenga, two experts from the World Bank, found that gender gaps in STEM fields are common around the world. According to the authors, in 2013 only four countries in Europe produced a pool of STEM graduates that were at least 15 percent female. In the United States, despite women earning more degrees than men overall, they account for only 35 percent of the undergraduate degrees issued in STEM fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "Munoz-Boudet and Revenga also note that in some areas, gender gaps in STEM fields are actually broadening. Between 2004 and 2014, the proportion of women earning engineering or computer science degrees in the United States fell.\n",
      "STEM FIELD FACULTY REMAINS PREDOMINANTLY MALE\n",
      "Gender gaps in academia are also apparent at the faculty level. In a post for the Brown Center on Education Policy, University of Missouri Professor Cory Koedel and Diyi Li examined data from over 40 public universities to explore diversity and wage gaps among the faculty. They found that women only account for 18.1-31.1 percent of faculty in STEM fields, but as much as 47.1-53.2 percent of faculty in non-STEM fields.\n",

      "Recognizing that woman are still underrepresented in STEM fields, experts from the Hamilton Project at Brookings explored what effect that has on patenting and innovation. Women earn  57 percent of all four-year degrees, but only 35 percent of STEM bachelor’s degrees. Following degree completion, they account for just 22 percent of the STEM workforce, and are responsible for only 16 percent of granted patents.\n",

Data show that women are now slightly ahead of men as a whole when it comes to developing the digital skills increasingly essential for employment, but remain grossly underrepresented in some of the most common tech jobs such as computer programming and information systems management.\n",

      "Yet India is playing catch-up in these vital areas. It devotes only 0.6 percent of GDP to R&D, well below the 2.74 percent in the United States and 2.07 in China.[5] Its limited investment has slowed innovation and put the country at an economic disadvantage. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that worldwide, AI will “increase global GDP by $15.7 trillion, a full 14%, by 2030.” But of this, $7 trillion is likely to accrue to China, $3.7 trillion to North America, and only $957 billion to India.[6]\n",
      "In the last three years, India has attracted less than $100 million in AI-oriented venture capital financing.[7] According to writer Ananya Bhattacharya, “the sector is dominated by American firms like Accenture, Microsoft, and Adobe, which have their innovation centres here [in India]. Home-grown efforts on the academic, business, and investor fronts are few.”[8] Seventy percent of the AI research in the nation occurs in non-Indian firms. As an illustration, in looking at research publications, 62 percent of it comes from Google and IBM employees working in India and “there is only one Indian company in the top 10.”[9]\n",
      "There is growing AI interest, however, as India starts to invest additional resources and deploy new AI applications. This year, the national government has doubled its investment in its innovation program known as Digital India to Rs3,063 crore (or $477 million) in order to fund advances in AI, machine learning, and 3-D printing.[10] The Ministry of Commerce and Industry has developed an AI Taskforce to develop policies that encourage innovation in these areas. Its recent report emphasized the need for greater investment, more AI research, revamping of school curricula, and additional innovation by the private sector.[11]\n",

      "“large financial bodies such as payment regulators handle billions of transactions each day across different channels such as ATM withdrawals, credit card payments, and e-commerce transactions. Advanced analytical techniques and ML [machine learning] algorithms, combined with human expertise allow institutions to flag transactions as potentially fraudulent at the time of occurrence and hence contain the damage as early as possible.”[12]\n",
      "These become particularly relevant given the recent discoveries of major fraudulent transactions in several large public and private sector banks in India. AI and ML techniques can be employed to create early warning systems and minimize human errors.\n",
      "Healthcare\n",
      "Advanced software helps health providers assess symptoms, diagnose disease, and plan appropriate treatments. According to writer Prakash Mallya, “the healthcare industry is relying on AI to fine-tune the accuracy of medical predictions and choose a fitting line of treatment.”[13] AI is a way to improve the quality of care while also containing medical costs. Beyond diagnosis and treatment, AI techniques and ML algorithms can also fine-tune interventions in public health policy across the country. There are large variations in the disease burden and demand for care across states of India, as well as across districts within large states such as Uttar Pradesh. The government can design real-time health interventions targeting specific populations, which is critically needed in Indian health policy.\n",

      "AI offers the hope of improving supply chain management and resource utilization. Both of these factors are vital for manufacturing and movement up the value chain. Factories and warehouses have difficulty managing logistics and forecasting the need for particular products. Software can help track supplies and make sure companies have what they need to make their products.[14] This is particularly important given the long term strategic role of the manufacturing sector for job creation and raising overall productivity in the economy.\n",
      "Crime Prediction\n",
      "Indian authorities are using AI developed abroad to anticipate crime and intervene before it happens. For example, an Israeli company called Cortica is working with the Best Group “to analyze the terabytes of data streaming from CCTV cameras in public areas. One of the goals is to improve safety in public places, such as city streets, bus stops, and train stations.” The firm is “looking for ‘behavioral anomalies’’ that signal someone is about to commit a violent crime.”[15] Given the various security risks that India faces, application of AI and ML can be instrumental in maintaining law and order as well as neutralizing extremist threats across states of the country.\n",
      "Precision Agriculture\n",
      "Farmers are seeking to deploy AI to increase crop yields. Using sensors that measure soil temperature and moisture, these software systems identify the ideal time for planting and harvesting, and help farmers make efficient use of pest control and fertilization. Suhas Wani, Director of the International Crop Research Institute notes “sowing date as such is very critical to ensure that farmers harvest a good crop. And if it fails, it results in loss as a lot of costs are incurred for seeds, as well as the fertilizer applications.”[16] The usage of AI is also potentially significant in weather insurance, where accurate estimates of local weather conditions are instrumental in designing insurance policies for agriculture and other industries.\n",
      "Based on these examples, it is clear India needs to encourage greater AI investment, see more support from government agencies, make it possible for private firms to develop novel applications, reform education programs in order to generate better AI training, and encourage the venture capital community to invest in India. Adoption of these actions would help India expand its GDP and build greater economic prosperity in the future.\n",

      "Some policymakers are taking such thinking to heart. Senator John Kennedy (R-LA) introduced a three-page bill, the “Own Your Own Data Act of 2019,” which declares that “each individual owns and has an exclusive property right in the data that individual generates on the internet” and requires that social media companies obtain licenses to use this data. Senators Mark Warner (D-VA) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) are filing legislation to require Facebook, Google, and other large collectors of data to disclose the value of personal data they collect, although the bill would not require payments. In California, Governor Gavin Newsome wants to pursue a “data dividend” designed to “share in the wealth that is created from [people’s] data.”\n",
      "Treating our data as our property has understandable appeal. It touches what the foundational privacy thinker Alan Westin identified as an essential aspect of privacy, a right “to control, edit, manage, and delete information about [individuals] and decide when, how, and to what extent information is communicated to others.” It expresses the unfairness people feel about an asymmetrical marketplace in which we know little about the data we share but the companies that receive the data can profit by extracting marketable information.\n",
      "The trouble is, it’s not your data; it’s not their data either.  Treating data like it is property fails to recognize either the value that varieties of personal information serve or the abiding interest that individuals have in their personal information even if they choose to “sell” it. Data is not a commodity. It is information. Any system of information rights—whether patents, copyrights, and other intellectual property, or privacy rights—presents some tension with strong interest in the free flow of information that is reflected by the First Amendment. Our personal information is in demand precisely because it has value to others and to society across a myriad of uses.\n",
      "Treating personal information as property to be licensed or sold may induce people to trade away their privacy rights for very little value while injecting enormous friction into free flow of information. The better way to strengthen privacy is to ensure that individual privacy interests are respected as personal information flows to desirable uses, not to reduce personal data to a commodity.\n",
      "Intersecting interests in personal information\n",
      "To unpack the private and public interests inherent in personal information, consider the simple case of your name. It is a fundamental part of individual identity, and it is the first item on any list of “personally identifiable information” protected by privacy rules. We each have vital interest in our names and the assets and identities we link to them.\n",
      "But this interest is not exclusive. Our names are also a way that others recognize us, associated by friends and family with who and what we are, and used by society for voting rolls, property registries, financial accounts, and countless other social, economic, and civic contexts. This makes our names essential social and economic currency that is valuable to others.\n",
      "It is because of this social and economic significance that naming is regulated. We are assigned names at birth, registered on birth certificates. It takes official approval to change these names. In this way, as personal as our identities are to us, they are also instruments of a well-functioning society.\n",
      "Other personal information that we necessarily share alongside our names also involves intersecting interests. The transactions we conduct through a bank become part of the business records of the bank, as the Supreme Court recognized in United States v. Miller. But the bank’s interest in these records does not necessarily mean it has absolute control to do what it wants with this information, as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley financial privacy law makes explicit. Courts have relied on Miller to conclude that records of your cell phone calls and other business records can be obtained from the parties that hold these records.\n",
      "In Carpenter v. United States last year, however, the Court required a warrant for cell phone location data that service providers retain for their use. Although not overturning Miller, the Court also recognized that that the phone users retain expectations of privacy in location data generated from their phones. The same intersecting interests apply to much of the other information we share as we interact with digital services—e-commerce transactions, mobile applications, messaging services and other communications, and pictures or information we share on our social networks among others.\n",
      "Of course, much of the data we generate is shared more widely than just with recipients like these, but here too the interests in information from the data are not exclusive. The digital economy operates in broad ecosystems of data-sharing for diverse uses. Well-accepted examples are for credit reporting; bank clearing and compliance with know-your-customer rules; fraud monitoring; and security. Many of these functions are recognized explicitly in laws and standards—from the first federal privacy law in 1970, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, to the recent European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act—while others are invisible. Few sectors exist entirely outside such ecosystems. And as businesses outsource functions and move their data processing onto cloud services and remote sensing of all kinds begins to deploy across environments, an increasing amount of personal data is in the custody of entities unknown to us as consumers.\n",

      "The most visible and debated of these ecosystems are in advertising and marketing. They are controversial both because the visibility to consumers makes them aware of tracking and data-sharing but also because mechanisms of ad-tech like advertising identifiers and cookies enable tracking across sites and devices, sharing information without our knowledge and sometimes even despite measures we take to avoid such tracking and sharing. In turn, data brokers aggregate and supplement much of this tracking information with other data derived from apps, social media, and public databases. As intrusive as such collection and uses can be, regulation must take into account First Amendment protection, which extends in some measure to advertising, and must recognize for better or worse that advertising supports a wide range of socially useful products and services, including vital news media and other content providers.\n",
      "In short, a significant amount of data sharing serves important public interests and values. The friction and disruption from any system of payments for data would undermine these interests and values. Yet, these costs would come with little benefit for individual privacy.\n",
      "Instead, what is needed is to enable the sharing personal information that is useful for our social, economic, and governmental systems while protecting the vital interests that each of us has in our personal information. It is precisely to these ends that we need to move away from our current transactional approach to privacy\n",
      "The handling of personal information in medical research and other research involving human subjects, detection of disparate impacts and analysis to identify discrimination, and the U.S. census provide examples where sharing of information provides important benefits for society. Most medical research is subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability of 1996 and the Privacy Rule adopted by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that defines numerous categories of personal information and limits how these can be disclosed and shared. Human subject research comes under HHS “Common Rule” that provides for institutional review boards to evaluate the risks to subjects, including their privacy, and how to address these risks.\n",
      "The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission requires employers to report data that includes gender and race or ethnicity. Without data as to race and other protected categories, discrimination is impossible to detect. Census data is considered important enough that we compel people to respond, but the law also limits the use of this data to statistical use, a limit so deeply embedded that anyone who handles the data must swear an oath to observe the limit, violation of which is a criminal offense. Consistent with these privacy obligations, the release of census data is vetted mathematically to avoid release of information at levels granular enough to associate data with individuals.\n",
      "In turn, census data provides a foundation for social science research of every kind, informing government policy at every level, academic research, and business planning and market research.  The census documentation of the U.S. population and society is available for free — an information commons created by public policy. It works fairly and consistently with our values because public policy also protects a baseline of protection for individual privacy interests. Baseline privacy requirements for how companies protect individual privacy can do the same in the commercial arena.\n",
      "Why property rights in data will not protect individuals effectively\n",
      "Basing privacy protection on property systems, on the other hand, would reduce privacy to a commodity, double down on a transactional model based on consumer choice, and be enormously complicated to implement. The current notice-and-choice model is failing because it is effectively impossible for users to understand either how their data will be used or the accompanying privacy risks, especially in the constant flow of online engagement in today’s connected world. The result is that people click past privacy notices through to the information or service they want.\n",
      "Moreover, many of these consumers already agree to provide personal information in exchange for the perception a benefit. It is hard to imagine people will burrow deeper into privacy disclosures or pause at clicking through to get at communications or transactions simply because they are offered what may amount to a few pennies.  It is far from clear that in a market for data, the ordinary user would come out on top—either in relation to economic benefits or privacy harms. On the contrary, by licensing the use of their information in exchange for monetary consideration, they may be worse off than under the current notice-and-choice regime.\n",
      "Indeed, the uncertainties of valuating any one individual’s data suggest that individuals will receive little payment. Estimates vary but The Financial Times has a calculator that one of us (Kerry) ran for his profile. The default value is $0.007, but as a well-to-do professional who travels a lot, the value of the Kerry data was estimated as $1.78. If pricing is set by service providers, then the resulting system is likely to end up being very similar to the current “take it or leave it” outcomes that are common under notice and choice. If pricing is set by consumers or through negotiation, the complexity of the service-user interactions would be even greater. And this new complexity would likely slow users’ access to information and services that they want—and simply turn “click fatigue” into “negotiation fatigue.”\n",

      "If pricing is set by regulators or a legislature, this could require drawing of lines about the use of information based on judgments that some should be favored and others disfavored (e.g., different pricing for medical research versus commercial data brokerage). Yet this approach might risk an adverse review under the Supreme Court’s First Amendment holding in Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., which rejected a Vermont limitation on a few particular uses of information about a pharmacy prescription transaction. Although the Sorrell case turned on particular decisions and statements made by the Vermont legislature, any privacy legislation is likely to face challenges under the First Amendment commercial speech doctrine, which encompasses commercial advertising within free speech protection on the basis of a “strong interest in the free flow of commercial information” on the part of both consumers and society. It is far from clear that a property rights approach to privacy would improve the arguments needed to withstand a constitutional challenge on such grounds.\n",
      "A property-based system also disregards interests besides property that individuals have in personal information. Consumers often benefit from freely providing information for use in a particular context, but they can suffer a range of privacy harms if the information is used in an unrelated context not contemplated when use of the information was licensed. At the same, imbuing property rights in personal information would affect sharing of data in many common contexts. In a simple purchase of a book from an online retailer, for example, the book title and subject could reveal highly personal information about the purchaser, but the retailer surely would have a right to retain and use its own business records about the transaction (including the title of the book).\n",
      "Under an information-as-property regime, would both the purchaser and the retailer have property rights to information about the transaction? And in such a property regime, couldn’t the retailer simply make as a condition of sale that the purchaser must grant a license to the retailer to use the information for specified uses? And wouldn’t that simply lead to another form of the tyranny of fine print in which the purchaser who wants the convenience of an online purchase would be forced to cede rights to the retailer? It is unclear whether the information as property regime would in fact improve the current state of privacy.\n",
      "Looking beyond this retail scenario, how would information-as-property apply to a simple online conversation between two individuals who exchange personal information with each other—perhaps even information about personal activities that the two individuals did together? Would both individuals have property interests in the personal information about a joint activity? Would that mean that neither individual could tell anyone else about the joint activity without the permission of the other individual? (Facebook allows users to delete or port their own photographs but not other people’s photos in which they are tagged).\n",
      "The European Union’s GDPR provides a benchmark for the complexity of introducing property interests into information ecosystems. The regulation required an enormous amount of systems design work to map data flows within organizations, document these for regulators, change user interfaces, and create the back-end systems to enable individual access, correction, and deletion. Microsoft revealed that it put 1,600 engineers on the task implementing the GDPR. Creating a system of micropayments similarly would add major new layers to user interfaces and back-ends systems.\n",
      "There are apps and proposals that seek to protect privacy through intermediaries. MIT’s big data pioneer Alexander Pentland and Thomas Hardjono have proposed that credit unions and labor unions could use their collective role to operate data cooperatives on behalf of their members, negotiating and managing permissions as well as deriving insights for their users. In a similar vein, CitizenMe is developing a data “exchange” that enables individuals to pool their data for surveys and other uses in exchange for compensation, and also to receive develop analysis of their data. In time, a privacy marketplace may develop platforms like these. In the meantime, the challenges of implementation, adoption, and permissions management across many different contexts and interests in information means these are not a substitute for widely applicable baseline privacy legislation.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Alan Westin’s insight about control has a place of honor in the constellation of individual interests that make up what we call privacy. But it should not be taken literally as the entirety, it cannot be exclusive, and it is not enough to protect interests that persist in personal information even after we share it with others.\n",
      "Privacy legislation should empower individuals through more layered and meaningful transparency and individual rights to know, correct, and delete personal information in databases held by others. But relying entirely on individual control will not do enough to change a system that is failing individuals, and trying to reinforce control with a property interest is likely to fail society as well. Rather than trying to resolve whether personal information belongs to individuals or to the companies that collect it, a baseline federal privacy law should directly protect the abiding interest that individuals have in that information and also enable the social benefits that flow from sharing information.\n",

      "Learning progressions have been described as roadmaps that help align curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment. These roadmaps point out important locations on the typical journey from novice to expert by describing what someone at each important location on the roadmap knows and can do. The descriptions highlight what is unique about each location, ensuring that differences between locations are emphasized so the transformations in skills and knowledge along the learning journey can be recognized. By mapping the journey, learning progressions help ensure the curriculum developers, teachers, and assessment designers are all working with the same destination in mind.\n",
      "Increasingly, learning progressions are being used both to construct assessment tools that will reflect the learning pathway, as well as to locate how students are meeting learning goals. Focussing on these two parallel functions can be useful to central education systems in evaluating new curricula.\t\n",

      "Different types of curriculum design require learning progressions of different grain sizes. When developing multi-year curricula, designers require coarse-grained learning progressions which describe learning over a long time period. An example from the USA illustrates how levels on a learning progression in science can be mapped to two or three grades each so the curriculum can be designed accordingly. This approach provides the opportunity to design evidence-based curricula which mirror the typical patterns of development for learners across grades because the learning progressions are founded on research.\n",
      "In the Philippines, we have applied this approach through fine-grained learning progressions that are being used to monitor student progress through the new science curriculum for Grades 7-10. The curriculum presents increasing levels of complexity from one grade to another in an upward spiraling progression, to develop deep understandings of core science concepts and skills. This provides the opportunity to construct tests that reflect this progression, and the test results can be used in multiple ways.\n",
      "We wanted to know whether students entering a grade had the pre-requisite knowledge, skills, and understanding needed to be able to engage successfully with the science chemistry curriculum at that grade level. To develop the tests used in this research, and with the support of the Philippines Department of Education, the Assessment Curriculum and Technology Research Centre (ACTRC) collaborated with colleagues from University of the Philippines National Institute for Science and Mathematics Education Development (UP NISMED), University of Philippines College of Education, and its Integrated School to audit the curriculum and identify the prerequisite conceptual knowledge and skills that are necessary for students to engage with the chemistry content in each of Grades 7-10. Using the audit information, test items were written to assess mastery of the identified concepts and skills.\n",
      "As students entered into each of the grade levels, they took the grade-appropriate test, which provided information about their readiness to engage with the curriculum. The results, aligned with the progressions, captured the levels of proficiency of students within each successive grade. Some students were still at early locations along the learning journey, while others had progressed further and employed more sophisticated chemical thinking. The levels on each learning progression were then compared to the pre-requisite skills and knowledge expected by the grade level curriculum and the percentage of students who are ready (and not ready) for the curriculum content were calculated.\n",

From the expert identification of what level of skill is required to enable students to engage successfully with the Grade 8 chemistry curriculum, students in Level C and above were found to be ready for the Grade 8 curriculum, while students in Level B and below were found to be unready. The differences between the knowledge and skills at Level B and Level C included the crucial distinction between representations of matter where differences can be seen by the naked eye and representations of matter where differences cannot be seen even with a microscope and must be understood conceptually. The results suggest that this fundamental change in how scientific knowledge is represented is one for which many of the students were unprepared when entering Grade 8 chemistry.\n",

Although the data capture what students can do and cannot do at each level of the progression, they don’t answer why this is happening—that is an issue that the Department of Education is exploring.

      "A three-legged stool can be tough to balance if the legs are uneven. We’ve been thinking a lot about how to do just that with the launch of the  Millions Learning Real-time Scaling Labs starting in Brazil, Jordan, Tanzania, Côte d’Ivoire, and the U.S. city of Philadelphia. How do we balance and give equal weight to our three primary objectives: learn from, document, and support education interventions in the process of scaling? We think that drawing from principles behind adaptive and iterative learning methodologies, such as improvement science, can help.\t\n",

      "Our starting point with the scaling labs is to learn more about how effective education interventions expand and deepen their impact—what we refer to as scale—especially among some of the world’s most marginalized communities. The global education community is learning a lot about how best to scale, some of which is seen in our 2016 report Millions Learning: Scaling Up Quality Education in Developing Countries. But there is certainly a lot more to learn, particularly around the core drivers behind adapting an evidenced-based initiative to a new context as well as about the enabling conditions in the environment that allow for good ideas to take root and spread. Through the lab process, we hope to learn even more about this scaling as it unfolds in real-time.\n",
      "Secondly, we hope to document this process so that we gain deeper insight into the scaling journey, not only to understand what outcomes are achieved but, just as importantly, to understand how they are achieved, and to be able to “tell the story of what happened” so that other decisionmakers can learn from it. We are thinking a lot about how best to capture and share this insight in an actionable way to help inform future policy, financing, and programmatic decisions around scaling in education.\n",
      "And the final leg of the stool is helping to support scaling efforts at the center of the Real-time Scaling Labs. Rather than merely learning from and documenting what is happening as external, silent observers, instead we are co-creating a peer-to-peer, iterative learning approach with partner institutions around the world to actively support the scaling process. During the three to four-year long lab process, we will routinely convene a diversity of stakeholders involved in the initiative(s) to identify scaling goals, develop and/or refine scaling action plans, and engage in a participatory and iterative process of implementing the scaling plan, reflecting on progress, and making course corrections along the way. The intention is to help strengthen capacity to scale among decision-makers through this participatory and applied research approach.\n",
      "In designing these Real-time Scaling Labs, we certainly didn’t start from scratch. We spent the past year researching a wide range of adaptive learning and collective impact approaches and considering how these methodologies might be applied to challenges around scaling in global education. One of the most useful approaches that we have drawn from is improvement science, a user-centered, problem-driven, iterative approach designed to accelerate learning-by-doing. Originally pioneered in the healthcare field by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, improvement science uses iterative cycles to rapidly test change ideas, and adjust based on data in a systemic rigorous way. I had the opportunity to attend the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching’s annual Summit on Improvement in Education earlier this month in San Francisco. At the conference, I heard about three key components of improvement science that really resonated with what we are trying to create with the scaling labs.\n",
      "1. Possibly incorrect and definitely incomplete\n",
      "Improvement science begins with the notion that the ideas we wish to test about how to improve education are possibly incorrect and definitely incomplete, and so will need to be reconsidered, adapted, and possibly even abandoned as we learn more. This notion is also at the core of the Real-time Scaling Labs, recognizing that scaling is not a linear process but is, in fact, cyclical, with ongoing challenges to overcome and opportunities to seize. We recognize that the first plan developed to scale an education intervention will most certainly not be the final one; it must change and be adapted throughout the process of scaling. Therefore, if we want to scale effectively and sustainably, we must continue to assess and adapt our strategies in response to ongoing changes that occur within any complex system, reacting to real-time learning rather than strictly adhering to our first assumptions. This underscores the importance of taking a flexible approach to designing, delivering, and financing interventions for scale. Part of this is also recognizing that setbacks will be an unavoidable and important part of the journey as they are critical moments to learn.\n",
      "2. Every system is perfectly designed to get the results that it gets\n",
      "Improvement science recognizes that we don’t exist in silos and vacuums. If we want to affect large-scale change, we must start by focusing on the broader system and understanding what in the system is producing the outcomes we currently see. Similarly, the scaling labs begin by convening a diverse group of stakeholders in-person to discuss and assess the nature of the problem the intervention(s) seeks to address and the system that produces it. By taking a systems approach, we are able to understand and address the processes and mechanisms within the system that are hindering the type of improvement we seek and to tackle the underlying causes behind the problems we are trying to solve. Additionally, by deliberately engaging a diverse composition of participants in the labs, we recognize the importance of getting multiple perspectives, as one person can only see part of the system.\n",

      "3. Control urges for solutionitis\n",
      "Before jumping to any conclusions about a potential solution, improvement science requires asking deeper questions about the data to truly understand the actual problem to be solved. An excellent speaker in one of the sessions I attended gave the example of the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials, which were decaying at an increasingly rapid rate. Evidence suggested it was a result of the cleaning process. Rather than rushing to make changes, improvement science led to asking why the monuments were cleaned so frequently and with such harsh chemicals. They found the frequent cleaning was to remove the large amount of bird droppings on the memorials. Why were so many birds flying over? Because of a large spider population on the memorials attracting the pigeons as food sources. And why so many spiders? Because of gnats swarming the monuments at dusk. And why so many gnats? They were drawn by the lighting of the monuments. This series of deep questions led to the decision to turn on the memorial lights one hour later, after sunset, eliminating the root cause of the problem (gnats). This will also be a core tenant of the scaling labs, as we will not be satisfied with identifying scaling challenges and opportunities to leverage at a surface level and jumping immediately to finding solutions, but rather will spend time to collectively understand the root causes and ensure our scaling plans seek to take those into account.\n",

      "Data analytics tools have the potential to transform health care in many different ways. In the near future, routine doctor’s visits may be replaced by regularly monitoring one’s health status and remote consultations. The inpatient setting will be improved by more sophisticated quality metrics drawn from an ecosystem of interconnected digital health tools. The care patients receive may be decided in consultation with decision support software that is informed not only by expert judgments but also by algorithms that draw on information from patients around the world, some of whom will differ from the “typical” patient. Support may be customized for an individual’s personal genetic information, and doctors and nurses will be skilled interpreters of advanced ways to diagnose, track, and treat illnesses. In a number of different ways, policymakers are likely to have new tools that provide valuable insights into complicated health, treatment, and spending trends.\n",

      "However, recent developments in data analytics also suggest barriers to change that might be more substantial in the health care field than in other parts of the economy. Despite the immense promise of health analytics, the industry lags behind other major sectors in taking advantage of cutting-edge tools. Most health care organizations, for example, have yet to devise a clear approach for integrating data analytics into their regular operations. One study even showed that 56 percent of hospitals have no strategies for data governance or analytics.\n",
      "Compared to other industries, the slow pace of innovation reflects challenges that are unique to health care in implementing and applying “big data” tools. These barriers include the nature of health care decisions, problematic data conventions, institutionalized practices in care delivery, and the misaligned incentives of various actors in the industry. To address these barriers, federal policy should emphasize interoperability of health data and prioritize payment reforms that will encourage providers to develop data analytics capabilities.\n",

      "Sensitivity of care decisions\n",
      "A major barrier to the widespread application of data analytics in health care is the nature of the decisions and the data themselves. Unlike many other industries, health care decisions deal with hugely sensitive information, require timely information and action, and sometimes have life or death consequences. Each of these features creates a barrier to the pervasive use of data analytics.\n",
      "The immediacy of health care decisions requires regular monitoring of data and extensive staffing and infrastructure to collect and tabulate information. The nature of health care decisions are more immediate and intrinsic than those made in other settings, creating a hesitancy about overhauling any major aspect of care provision. Health care decisions must take into account patient preferences, which at times differ from expert recommendations.\n",

      "The importance and complexity of these decisions means physicians and patients insist on very high standards for data-analytics tools in health care. That has proven very challenging to designers of these tools, as health providers are more accustomed to dealing with either broad knowledge or narrow choices rather than complex predictions that require careful identification of decisions and calibration of predictions. As a result, clinical decision support software has struggled to make better insights than physicians. Even one of the most advanced systems, IBM’s Watson, made a series of “unsafe and incorrect treatment recommendations” because it was calibrated based on synthetic cases rather than real patient data. There is risk even when training software uses real patient data because decision support software may overfit its models and thereby make less useful suggestions, such as prescribing an inappropriate treatment plan. Sometimes, the clinically best medical decision is not always what a patient wants to pursue.\n",
      "The sensitive nature of health care decisions and data furthermore creates major concerns about privacy. Patients are rightfully concerned about the security of their data and concerned about it being used in ways that are detrimental to them, damage their reputations, or disadvantage them in the rating and marketing decisions of insurers. This isn’t limited to medical record data. Recent news coverage of the capture of the Golden State Killer, for example, has raised new questions about the privacy of direct-to-consumer genetic testing. And while the growth of “wearables” such as FitBit and Nike+ FuelBand have made health status monitoring accessible to patients, these data are not subjected to federal patient privacy laws, allowing these companies to design their own internal privacy policies and share information with third-parties.\n",
      "Problematic data conventions\n",
      "Several data conventions in health care hinder the widespread use of data analytics. Currently, health care data are split among different entities and have different formats such that building an insightful, granular database is next to impossible. These qualities greatly increase the cost of using data to provide value, even when all the relevant information has been recorded in some form. Furthermore, even well-structured data are often not available to researchers or providers who could use them in useful ways.\n",
      "Several data conventions in health care hinder the widespread use of data analytics. Currently, health care data are split among different entities and have different formats such that building an insightful, granular database is next to impossible.\n",
      "In general, the health care industry has been resistant to making information available as open data commons, which are up-to-date data provided in accessible format and available to all. That resistance comes in part from fear of violating privacy, even though existing strategies for protecting confidentiality greatly mitigate that risk. A larger reason is that data commons are a public good and will naturally be undersupplied by the market. A third data challenge is data quality. For analysis or predictions to have any value, they must be based on good data. One of the most hyped applications of big data in epidemiology, Google Flu Trends, turned out to underperform far more basic models, despite analyzing far more data, because its analysts were extrapolating from the behavior of Google users—an unrepresentative group of people. The experience illustrated that the success of data analytics in health care is dependent upon the availability and utilization of quality data.\n",
      "Institutional practices\n",
      "Entrenched practices in the delivery of health care also create several barriers to the full adoption of data analytics. One clear illustration of the challenge is in one of the most promising areas of data analytics: clinical decision support. While data analytics could greatly improve the clinical decision-making process, the development of decision support tools hasn’t paid sufficient attention to how decisions are actually made and the related workflows supporting those decisions. The tools often assume that putting the right information on a single person’s dashboard can induce them to make the right decision, but in reality, most difficult clinical decisions involve many actors and often follow institutional guidelines designed by committees. Data tools that do not fit into existing work and decision-making structures add burdens to physicians and are much less effective than they could be. For example, many attempts to bring data analytics or other information technology into health care have created a large data entry burden for physicians. This had led to high-profile mistakes, physician burnout, and general dissatisfaction with the tools.\n",
      "As a consequence, most of the major reasons physicians cite for their resistance to adoption of new data tools are related to workflow disruption. For data analytics to truly transform care, the designers of tools need to cognizant of the context their tools will be used in and health care organizations must be willing to reorganize some elements of their practice to empower patients and providers to use data-driven care.\n",
      "Misaligned incentives\n",
      "Arguably the largest barrier to the implementation and application of data analytics in health care is the splintered landscape of the industry, with separate components having their own incentives that diverge from what might be best for the entire system. At the moment, physicians or delivery systems may not know that their patients have visited emergency rooms, for example, unless told by the insurer—because claims data are held by the payer. Meanwhile, care providers may hold clinical data that could help insurers better manage their patient’s costs. The responsibility for managing any given patient is split between their insurer and various providers, each with different incentives and needs and neither functioning as an ideal agent for the patient.\n",
      "Insurers have incentives to invest in better health for their covered population, but these incentives are mitigated by annual contracts with employers or individuals and employee turnover, which moves many enrollees to a different insurer before the payer’s investments in their health pay off. There are also serious concerns with expecting insurers to take the lead on data analytics in health care. First, data tools designed for insurers are likely to center on costs, which may leave some quality-enhancing insights unexplored. Second, insurer data analytics may impose an externality on hospitals and physicians, which have to bear the administrative costs of complying with the data practices of various insurers. Third, insurers may not conduct their data analytics on a clinically useful timetable. Unless they feed data to providers continuously, it may not be timely enough to affect how patients receive care. The limited degree to which insurers provide claims data to providers that they contract with may reflect the expense of doing so, limitations in their legacy IT systems, or a desire to retain more of the care management responsibility.\n",
      "The responsibility for managing any given patient is split between their insurer and various providers, each with different incentives and needs and neither functioning as an ideal agent for the patient.\n",
      "Health care providers have their own particular incentives. Under the most common payment schemes, providers typically have little incentive to control patient costs. However, they likely do care about quality of care, even if they are hesitant to change their institutional practices and norms. Despite seeming like a more logical locus for data decisions, hospitals are often unwilling to undertake the costs of developing data capabilities or the disruption of implementing their use into regular practice. Hospitals also have an incentive to slow health information exchange standards because the lack of interoperability binds physicians into referral patterns favorable to them. Similarly, vendors of health information technology often don’t want standardization of data tools and practices because differentiation of their products and high costs for providers that switch vendors create substantial monopoly power for vendors. Finally, patients themselves often don’t support data practices that can improve care for all. The fear of data breaches or misuse leads patients to oppose data sharing arrangements that may have widespread positive externalities. In short, no individual actor in the health care space has the incentives or means to fully embrace the most revolutionary data analytics practices.\n",
      "Policy recommendations\n",
      "Because of the systemic challenges described above, we need policy changes that diminish the barriers to health analytics. While there is potential for radical overhaul, the initial priority should be making sure all hospitals can record, use, and share patient data in useful ways. One critical component of that agenda is ensuring interoperability of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). Federal policy has contributed a great deal to the adoption of EMRs and other health IT practices through incentives under the Medicare program, but providers still struggle with sharing that data. As discussed above, neither hospitals nor EMR vendors have a strong incentive to standardize health information exchanges, despite the fact that interoperable EMRs can improve care and save money. The 2009 Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act included health information exchange as one of the required capabilities for certified EMR systems. However, this requirement was included at a later implementation stage, allowing EMR systems to be designed and integrated into health systems without these capabilities, making interoperability even more difficult. In 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act increased incentives and penalties specifically promoting EMR interoperability.\n",
      "These incentives need not aim to establish one universal EMR. Applications that can access and transfer health data from different kinds of EMRs can achieve interoperability, but they are not used as widely or thoroughly as possible, risking a situation where the applications meant to bridge different EMRs themselves fail to adopt uniform data conventions. Federal policy could standardize the way EMR data are accessed and transferred by applications, like Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), that exist to facilitate interoperability. It could also revise HITECH and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to allow fees for data exchange, thus creating incentives to improve data exchange that could potentially counteract the existing disincentives. Federal support for best practices in data management and use would go a long way in helping the industry develop its own capabilities.\n",
      "The federal government can also indirectly support the development of health data analytics by continuing to encourage payment based on the value of care, typically through the Medicare program, encouraging alternative payment approaches, and by working to align quality measures and payment approaches with private insurers. Under value-based care models, providers are typically paid some amount per beneficiary based on the package of care they are expected to deliver, with payment at least partially tied to quality-of-care metrics. These models aim to create the incentive for providers to provide high-quality care at lower costs, which often involves closer coordination of care and careful revision of many practices. All these features make hospitals operating under value-based care models better loci for data-backed decisions. Kaiser Permanente has demonstrated the power of a well-integrated data strategy aimed at managing costs and quality. Conversely, improved data analytics capabilities may be precisely what health care providers need to better coordinate and improve value of care. Medicare could improve the usability of its data for a wider audience with a varying degree of analytic capabilities to help more of these providers successfully implement these new health care models. Coupling these systemic health care reforms can allow them to complement each other and reduce administrative confusion.\n",
      "Federal support for best practices in data management and use would go a long way in helping the industry develop its own capabilities.\n",
      "One factor that is holding back progress toward value-based payment is risk adjustment—varying the payment on the basis of how challenging one provider’s patients are in comparison to other providers. Much of the energy in improving risk adjustment has focused on contracts between purchasers and insurers—for example, between the Medicare program and Medicare Advantage plans. But the risk adjustment challenges for contracts between insurers and providers are distinct from these and, if ignored, pose grave challenges to some of the best providers, who inevitably attract patients with the most challenging conditions.\n",
      "Despite the disruptions to conventional practices, all actors in health care should be excited about the possibilities that new data tools will bring. But obtaining this enormous potential is not around the corner and will require overcoming challenges by all of the relevant components of the health care system.\n",

      "The definitive work on emerging technology and insurgency has yet to be written, but two recent books offer suggestions for how the era of big data and AI will affect the United States’ modern conflicts. Small Wars, Big Data: The Information Revolution in Modern Conflict, by Eli Berman, Joseph Felter, and Jacob Shapiro, offers few musings about the future of insurgency, but lays out a compelling theory about the ways in which information shapes insurgent violence. By contrast, Paul Scharre’s excellent new book, Army of None: Autonomous Weapons and the Future of War, offers little in the way of counterinsurgency strategy, but is wholly concerned with how artificial intelligence will reshape armed conflict. Taken together, they begin to sketch out a vision for how AI and big data might alter insurgent dynamics.\n",
      "The core insight of Small Wars, Big Data is that insurgencies are ultimately competitions over information rather than territory or ideology. Since insurgents can readily blend in with their surrounding populations, regime forces cannot defeat an insurgency unless the local population identifies who and where the insurgents are. The challenge for the state is thus to convince local civilians to provide that information, while the challenge for insurgents is to persuade them not to. In Berman, Felter, and Shapiro’s telling, just about everything that happens in an insurgency—from building schools and hospitals on the one hand, to the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians on the other—can be read as an attempt to coax or intimidate civilians into divulging or withholding what they know.\n",
      "Small Wars, Big Data is by no means the first to offer that argument. But it is unique in terms of the breadth and depth of the empirical evidence it marshals. From the pioneering research of Stathis Kalyvas in the early 2000s on, political scientists from Lisa Hultman to Laia Balcells have compiled an extraordinary body of empirical work on the “micro-foundations” of insurgent and civil war violence. As leading contributors to that literature themselves, the authors do an admirable job of surveying its findings.\n",
      "Of particular note is chapter four, which offers a thorough overview of the debate regarding the effects of developments in information technology on insurgent violence. As the authors note, on the one hand, information technology may reduce insurgent attacks by making it easier for states to gather intelligence about the insurgents. On the other, it may instead increase attacks by enabling insurgents to better coordinate with one another. By comparing the rollout of cell phone networks with insurgent violence in Iraq, the authors show that cell phones—by offering low cost, anonymous ways of supplying information about insurgents at little risk to the informant—do appear to reduce and disrupt insurgent activity. That the Taliban in Afghanistan and Boko Haram in Nigeria have both repeatedly targeted cell phone towers, despite the improved communication they enable, suggests that even insurgents themselves fear that information technology has tilted the balance of power to the state.\n",
      "For all its strengths, Small Wars, Big Data is not without its flaws. One is that it gives short shrift to the kind of “brute force” tactics that Jacqueline Hazelton discussed in a controversial article last summer. The book would have been stronger if it had discussed at greater length why exploiting information technology is more effective at defeating insurgencies than draconian policies like mass incarceration, mass resettlement, or even mass killing. But the other critique is that the book’s title hints at a topic it never addresses: It is primarily a book about the role of information in insurgency, rather than information technology. The title makes for great marketing, but it’s a bit of misnomer.\n",

      "Army of None, by contrast, more than lives up to its billing. Scharre has spent nearly a decade framing the early debate over autonomous weapons in D.C. and the Pentagon, and the experience shows. The book plainly and masterfully lays out the major questions that AI and autonomous weapons raise for the future of armed conflict. Although written for a popular audience, even well-informed academics will find it worthwhile as an introduction to the technical, ethical, and strategic issues that AI-infused weapons systems will introduce.\n",
      "Scharre’s argument about the coming ubiquity of big data and AI has profound implications for the future of insurgency. Very roughly, two futures are possible. In one, AI and autonomous weapons are both distributed and commoditized, such that insurgents can afford weapons systems that are nearly as capable as those of any given regime. Think of the commercial off-the-shelf drones that the Islamic State has deployed in Iraq and Syria, but with low-level intelligence and object-detection baked in via Tensorflow. Since many of the cutting-edge AI projects are open source and publicly available, it may well be possible to build makeshift lethal autonomous weapons systems that are nearly as good as state-of-the-art systems but at a fraction of the cost. In such a scenario, the balance may shift slightly to insurgents; one shudders to imagine the carnage a Mumbai-style attack could produce if the attackers had lethal drone swarms at their disposal.\n",
      "However, if the future of artificial intelligence is one that favors scale and centralization, then AI may give the upper hand to regime forces. In this world, regimes with access to the products and infrastructure of a great power, like the United States or China, may rapidly unravel insurgent networks. We might think of this as the “wars of none” scenario, since the regime’s overwhelming informational advantage may come to limit the need for violence altogether.\n",

      "Recall that the central point of Small Wars, Big Data is that insurgencies are primarily contests for information about the identity and location of insurgents, and that even relatively simple technology—such as a text-based tipline—appears to make it much easier for states to gain that information. What happens when tiplines are replaced with real-time surveillance systems equipped with facial recognition? As the cost of ubiquitous surveillance drops, we may see the emergence of a new counterinsurgency strategy: Whereas the “hearts-and-minds” approach tries to coax information out of civilians and the “brute force” approach attempts to coerce it, the “big brother” approach may bypass civilians altogether. There’s little need for informants if you have enough sensors, cameras, and processing power to recognize and track everyone, everywhere.\n",
      "Although such a scenario may seem far-fetched, early versions are already feasible. In the United States, Anduril Industries, the latest security startup funded by Peter Thiel, is fast at work building an “electronic” wall that has already proven remarkably effective at detecting and monitoring unauthorized border crossings in Texas. In China, meanwhile, authorities have responded to deadly attacks in Xinjiang by widely deploying facial recognition and mass surveillance technology there. And the capabilities of Chinese authorities are only set to grow: Beijing recently announced a massive new investment in SenseTime, an AI startup whose next generation product aims to identify objects and individuals across 100,000 live camera feeds simultaneously.\n",
      "Whether AI and information technology will empower states or insurgents remains unclear. Most likely it will do both, with AI and information technology supercharging insurgencies in failing or weak countries while constraining the space in which insurgency can occur everywhere else. What seems certain is that the information revolution is poised to revolutionize insurgency soon too.\n",

      "The global growth of microfinance banks has created new opportunities for financial inclusion, with outstanding lending of $100 billion to around 200 million clients. Yet the majority of lending from microfinance institutions has been to urban populations and not to the rural poor or small farmers.\n",
      "Farmers with access to finance can invest in fertilizers and seeds to increase their yields and incomes potentially by more than 25 percent.\n",
      "There are well known reasons that make lending money to farmers so hard. Farmers are spread out across large thinly populated areas making them costly to reach and serve; they have few realizable assets to pledge as collateral against loans; and they generally have no financial history, which is needed for credit scoring. And on top of all that, agriculture is regarded as a risky business, often at the mercy of the weather. Yet farmers with access to finance can invest in fertilizers and seeds to increase their yields and incomes potentially by more than 25 percent.\n",
      "New technologies have the potential to give farmers access to the financial tools necessary for such growth.\n",
      "The rise of mobile phones in rural areas has been dramatic with over 90 percent of Africans able to access cellphone services, and many farmers now use cellphones to make calls, send text messages, and access data and informational services. The adoption of mobile money services has mirrored cellphone growth, allowing users to send and receive funds using a network of local agents.\n",

      "Source: Chart adapted from “The Mobile Economy Sub-Saharan Africa 2017”\n",
      "Big data analytics for credit risk assessment has been on the rise across urban areas of developing countries over the past years. Several startups offer loans to previously un-bankable customers using cellphone data (call data records, mobile money data, and social media data). This data is processed by algorithms, generating a predictive score of a person’s likelihood to repay a loan.\n",
      "Crop suitability mapping enables lenders to understand how risky a farmers production is, based on where they are located (using geo-mapping techniques, lenders are able to ensure that they only lend to a farmer growing a suitable crop in a suitable location).\n",
      "Can this new technology really make farmers bankable?\n",
      "Imagine a poor farmer in Ghana that has been growing beans to sell into the local market. After providing for her family, she doesn’t have enough money left over to purchase high quality seeds or fertilizers, even though such inputs would increase the amount of beans she will grow. She tried borrowing from the local microfinance bank, but since she had never saved with them before, they are not willing to grant her a loan. Suddenly she receives a text message asking if she’d like to apply for a loan to pay for inputs. She clicks “yes,” and receives an automated message saying she has received the loan. The loan automatically goes into her mobile money account, and she visits the supply store to purchase seeds and fertilizers. Next harvest she produces 30 percent more beans than usual. After selling her crops she visits the local mobile money agent to repay the loan and interest. As a result, she is left with more money than normal, so she joins the local microfinance bank to open a savings account with the surplus funds. Now, she is an individual with a bank account opening further opportunities for her and her family.\n",
      "The story above is not yet happening but is a distinct possibility and illustrates how technology can transform a farmer into a profitable borrower. While cellphone-based lending is starting to happen in Africa, with products such as MShwari in Kenya, this type of lending so far has been mainly for small, short-term loans for urban customers. Farmers who are less tech-savvy and need larger, longer-term loans repayable at the end of the season cannot benefit from existing mobile loan services. Yet by transforming the application process into a simple automated cellphone-based application, transaction costs plummet and remote farmers can access the service. By using cellphone records for credit scores, previously “un-scorable” customers are now ratable. Using agronomic geospatial data ensures that lending is only given to farmers growing the right crops in the right location. Migrating cash management to mobile money platforms dramatically reduces money disbursement and recovery costs. The mix of these technologies could grant access to seasonal lending to smallholder farmers.\n",
      "Perhaps the nearest example of this technological convergence to date is Safaricom’s DigiFarm and Connected Farmer model in Kenya. The platform offers a range of services to farmers including e-vouchers for quality inputs at discounted prices; access to agriculture advice services via a training module; and advice on how to appropriately use inputs like seed and fertilizer. Digifarm also offers farmers the opportunity to apply, via their cellphones, for a loan to be used to purchase agricultural inputs, although data on total lending and repayment rates is not yet available. The loan module appears to build upon their proven success with the M-Shwari mobile microloan available to Sarfaricom customers.\n",
      "If Digifarm and other similar services achieve success, we are likely to see many other mobile companies, banks, and startups replicate their models.  Most exciting of all is the impact that this will have on farmers who will have increased opportunities to invest in their endeavors.\n",

      "Finance ministers need to think about reforms to fiscal systems in order to raise more revenue from taxes on carbon-intensive fuels and less revenue from other taxes that are detrimental to economic performance, such as taxes on labor and capital. They need to evaluate the carbon tax rates that will help them meet their mitigation pledges for Paris and accompanying measures to help low-income households vulnerable to higher energy prices,” said Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n",

      "World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim is equally clear: “There has never been a global movement to put a price on carbon at this level and with this degree of unison. It marks a turning point from the debate on the economic systems needed for low-carbon growth to the implementation of policies and pricing mechanisms to deliver jobs, clean growth and prosperity.” \n",
      "The two leaders made these statements as they announced a new alliance of national, state, and local policymakers called the Carbon Pricing Panel.  OECD Secretary General Angel Gurria is also involved.\n",
      "The current groundswell of support for measures that would increase the relative price of fossil fuels (such as cap-and-trade systems and carbon taxes) arguably took root at the United Nations Climate Summit in 2014, where 74 countries and more than 1,000 companies expressed support for a price on greenhouse gas emissions. At the summit, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon encouraged “more governments and companies to embrace carbon pricing as a valuable tool for limiting further global temperature rise.” The momentum also follows from a series of excellent IMF publications showing how countries can benefit directly by eliminating distortionary (and sometimes regressive) fossil energy subsidies and pricing energy efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "To economists who have long regarded pricing carbon as critical to reducing the risk of climatic disruption, last week’s chorus of world leaders calling for such measures is welcome music. \n",
      "To those of us who contribute to the research literature, recent remarks by the new chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Dr. Hoesung Lee (an economist), are especially validating: “If you ask me to choose the most important work in climate change issues, then I’ll choose carbon price. That’s because it is the driver to put us into the right track.” In his new role, Dr. Lee has a golden opportunity to encourage this “most important work” and finally give it the attention it is due; while a compelling body of peer-reviewed literature on greenhouse gas pricing policies has accrued over recent decades, the IPCC has so far given it short shrift in its encyclopedic climate change reviews. For example, the latest IPCC Assessment Report (the AR5) dedicates about seven out of 4000+ pages to carbon pricing policies, and that’s up from about two pages of coverage in the previous Assessment Report. To be fair, the IPCC’s reports cover the universe of climate science, impacts, and mitigation research. Moreover, the IPCC’s work program is subject to the fraught consensus of member countries and cannot be policy prescriptive. On the other hand, it is hard to believe that the IPCC is fulfilling its mandate to be policy relevant with such scant attention to scholarship on the most cost-effective solutions to the problem.\n",

      "Leaving aside the bigger picture of how the IPCC might best shift its focus from the increasingly settled science to sensible solutions, here’s a proposal for a first redress of this woeful gap: the IPCC should prepare a Special Report specifically on carbon pricing. It should review the extensive peer-reviewed literature on the economic and environmental outcomes of policies that discourage greenhouse gas emissions through market forces, examining the important design elements of such policies and elucidating the tradeoffs across numerous policy objectives. It can cite examples of such policies around the world (including those adopted by sub-national governments) and summarize analyses of how they have worked. The report should also synthesize the research on how carbon pricing policies compare and interact with other measures, such as technology-specific regulations and subsidies, and explain how carbon pricing can fit in the broader landscape of fiscal policies. The report should also outline important findings about the potential benefits and challenges, economically and environmentally, of restructuring consumption-distorting fossil fuel subsidies. \n",

      "One problem arises. Dr. Lee cannot pursue the preparation of a Special Report without a request from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This means that the proposal must originate directly from a government; as supportive as Dr. Lee, Madame Lagarde, and President Kim may be, this idea cannot come from them. It falls to the Obama Administration or heads of other UNFCCC Parties to ask the IPCC to bring forward this report. The opportunity to build on the current momentum around carbon pricing is extraordinary. Which leader will step up?\n",

      "There have been several attempts to explain the science of Santa. Dr. Larry Silverberg, an engineering professor at North Carolina State University, postulated that Santa uses relativity clouds (i.e. wormholes) to control space-time, thereby extending the length of time he has to deliver presents to several months. \n",
      "While an interesting theory, it does not address the dangers associated with using wormholes as a method of transportation, such as their nature to suddenly collapse or expose the traveler to hazardous radiation or exotic matter. It certainly doesn’t sound like something Mrs. Claus would allow Santa and his reindeer to travel through if there were a safer and easier way.\n",
      "A far more plausible solution is that we are just now beginning to “invent” the technology that Santa has been using for hundreds of years. As I’ll explain below, all he needs is a fleet of 29,463 Rudolph 2.0s (what you may know as drones). \n",

      "A few years ago, Philip Bump made some calculations about Santa’s travels on Christmas Eve. For the sake of this back-of-the-Christmas-card calculation, let’s assume he’s right and that the number of children under 14 who celebrate Christmas still rounds to 526,000,000. This doesn’t account for the percentage of “good” children – the ones who will actually get presents from Santa. If ten percent of children are on the naughty list, this lowers the number of children who will receive presents from Santa to 473,000,000. Taking the average number of children per house to be 2, this means Santa must visit 237,000,000 houses. \n",
      "Since one million drones will be given as gifts this Christmas (let’s assume they’re all going to children), Santa can simply send these to their final destination and have them carry the presents for the other assumed child in the house. It’s pretty unlikely that any one household will have two children getting a drone, so we can say that Santa has to visit just 236,000,000 houses. With an assumed average distance between houses of 1.5 miles, Santa has to cover 353,600,000 miles in 24 hours. Without the use of drones, this would be over 14,700,000 miles per hour – well below the speed of light, but far beyond the realm of plausible. \n",

      "Given that U.S. government drones can fly about 400 miles per hour and that Santa and his helpers (who, by the way, are increasingly worried about robots taking their jobs) have been improving this technology for hundreds of years, it’s safe to say that Rudolph 2.0 can fly at least 500 miles per hour. They used to fly solely on the Christmas spirit, but given the steadily increasing number of children in the world who don’t believe in Santa, Santa has since had to turn to solar panels to power them. If a Rudolph 2.0 arrives at a house and discovers that it brought the wrong present for a child, there is no reason to worry. All Rudolph 2.0s have built-in 3-D printers, and a new toy can quickly and easily be made on-site.\n",
      "We made many assumptions throughout these calculations – some were better than others. The numbers will change from year to year, as will the types of presents delivered, but the technical plausibility will only increase as technology advances. We still have a few questions, such as whether Santa hides the drones from sight using invisibility cloaks, whether he will have to register his Rudolph 2.0s with the Federal Aviation Administration, and whether climate change is impacting his command and control center at the North Pole. \n",
      "Nevertheless, we certainly appreciate all the work that Santa does, delivering presents to all the good children around the world who celebrate Christmas with a fleet of just 29,463 Rudolph 2.0s. Happy Holidays from TechTank!\n",

      "BODY:\n",
      "\n",
      "How potent is pot? This seemingly basic question is a serious one for state marijuana industries and the agencies that regulate them. Last week, the Colorado Department of Revenue—the state’s marijuana regulatory agency—released a report on equivalency, potency, and dosing that offered important answers to that question. In the process, the study also engaged another critical aspect of marijuana products: equivalency in composition. That is, how much marijuana does it take to produce the items demanded at market: flower, edibles, concentrates, tinctures, etc.\n",
      "The report was funded by the Colorado Department of Revenue (via a legislative mandate: Colorado HB 14-1361) and penned by the University of Colorado, the Marijuana Policy Group, and a Denver-based consulting firm. Over the course of a few dozen pages, the authors tackle the issue by examining industry activity, regulatory demands, technological innovation, and medical literature.\n",
      "Marijuana potency versus equivalency\n",
      "It is important to start with some technical terminology to understand what the report offers. However, before diving into definitions, the technical nature of the language used to discuss the topic in the report suggests something important about marijuana and the burgeoning legal industry that has sprung up around it. Legal marijuana operations are high-tech, advanced, innovative, scientific, steeped in R&D, and staffed by knowledgeable professionals. It is increasingly a mature market that looks less like the stereotypical basement hothouse and more like corporate production in the agriculture, pharmaceutical, and manufacturing sectors of the American economy. That economic and industrial maturation comes not just from the store fronts and the grow operations, but from the investment, expertise, research, and entrepreneurial rigor that exists behind these enterprises. Like it or not, support it or oppose it, embrace it or wish it away, the marijuana industry is exactly that: an industry—driven by market actors and subject to market forces.\n",
      "Now for some lingo from the report. The report distinguishes two important terms critical for consumers, industry, and regulators to understand: potency and equivalency. Potency is fairly basic, and its most common use involves the strength of THC in the marijuana product. \n",
      "Equivalency is different. It focuses on inputs and outputs and varies depending on the type of equivalency under analysis. One type is “physical equivalency.” Physical equivalency measures how much raw marijuana is required to produce a given output: flower, concentrate for vaporization, concentrate for producing edibles, other tinctures, oils, etc. This varies dramatically depending on the consumer product and the uptake method (method of use/consumption). The other type is “pharmacological equivalency.” Pharmacological equivalency measures the relationship between THC content in an input (and other psychoactive substances derived from marijuana) and the given product (output). Pharmacological equivalency matters considerably for use, dosing, pricing, and regulation. The report goes on to tie each equivalency for given types of products to their pricing, as a means of seeing whether the price is proportionally responsive to production inputs—physical mass or THC content. \n",
      "I will not lay out the findings in this blog post, but the report offers substantial detail on production processes, extraction techniques, and uptake methods and what each means for the value and use of marijuana in Colorado’s legal market. However, beyond Colorado, the report offers critical information and/or research methods for analysts in other state agencies and industries asking similar questions.\n",
      "The marijuana market works just like other markets\n",
      "One important finding from the report focuses on whether marijuana production and pricing efficiently reflects differences in inputs. That is, does more potent marijuana cost more? Does marijuana that is more manufacturing-intensive or subject to greater production losses cost more? In a basic market sense, these answers should be easy. In most product markets across the US, producers have answers to those questions. For the marijuana industry, those answers have been in question for a variety of reasons. First, the industry is new from a legal perspective, having previously operated in the shadows of the black market. Second, because marijuana is such a diverse product and research into the plant has been stymied by state and federal laws, the knowledge base–and the capacity to build that knowledge base–has been quite limited. Third, skepticism about the maturity of the industry, its actors, and the operation of individual enterprises abounds, as the marijuana industry tries to distinguish itself from pre-existing stereotypes that predate legalization. \n",
      "Market pricing, particularly in new markets with incomplete information and limited research and development, can be a tremendous challenge. In fact, pricing in any market can be a challenge. However, this report suggests that the marijuana industry has done a remarkable job in ensuring that their prices well reflect manufacturing processes and inputs. That is, production and pharmacological values also maintain proportional price equivalencies. Although the industry is regulated in a unique way, produces a controversial product, and operates in a bizarre legal environment that turns federalism on its head, marijuana businesses are not unique. Despite the challenges marijuana businesses face, they largely operate like any other business or industry.\n",
      "The importance of seed-to-sale tracking\n",
      "Colorado uses software and hardware from a company called METRC to track and monitor inventory and production process. This monitoring system is often called “seed-to-sale tracking” as it makes every effort to track product from the moment it is planted to the moment it leaves the shelf in a consumer’s hand. The system and processes behind it operate on a basic radio frequency system, but offers a complex and comprehensive means of keeping track of the inventory supply chain in ways that help prevent diversion. I have previously called this system the backbone of the regulatory model in Colorado.\n",

      "The equivalency report, however, shows even additional added value from Colorado’s seed-to-sale tracking system. Because of the level of detail and types of data that state regulators required be collected, the system—and its associated database—allow researchers the capacity to analyze myriad questions, including product equivalencies. Researchers were able to examine product, trace the lineage of that product back to the plant-level. At the same time, the system maintains data on the specific production processes plants and products are subject to, such that researchers were able to consider how specific plants, plant types, strains, producers, manufacturing processes and production methods factored into the relative quantities sold at market.\n",
      "The seed-to-sale tracking system shows itself to do more than simply help regulators, prevent diversion, and keep US Attorneys at bay by satisfying some of the requirements of the Cole Memo. The system is a researcher’s dream, and allows the state to address existing needs, answer critical policy questions, and broaden the conversation about how to administer, manage, and run a heavily regulated industry. Moreover, the findings from research based on seed-to-sale data have interstate benefits. States facing challenges with their own marijuana regulatory systems or operators facing questions about their industry can employ Colorado data to help address those needs. States looking to set up a new system or activists interested in drafting ballot initiatives or legislation can use the seed-to-sale system to understand how the market functions and how production processes operate. Finally, the data are also useful for conversations emerging from opponents of legalization, concerned about some of the implications of the new product. Industry and regulatory data in itself can help engage such concerns and can be paired with health and safety data to understand more clearly the impact of legal marijuana on the state and its residents. \n",
      "My colleague, Philip Wallach, explained the policy benefits Washington state’s legal marijuana system would accrue because of legal requirements for research and data analysis on its own system. Seed-to-sale tracking in Colorado allows similar benefits as it opens doors for expansive research.\n",

Don’t be fooled by a milquetoast name, the Colorado Department of Revenue’s report, “Marijuana Equivalency in Portion and Dosage” is well-researched, contributing to our understanding of marijuana production and the methods and tools that can be used to engage empirical questions that emerge from this new legal industry.\n",

      "TITLE:Life Sciences Startups: Mixed News\n",
      "BODY:\n",
      "\n",
      "We have authored two papers recently for the Brookings Institution documenting the 30-year decline in the “startup rate,” or the percentage of firms aged less than one year as a share of all firms. Our data show this decline in the U.S. economy as a whole, in all 50 states, in all major industries, and in all but one of the country’s 366 largest metropolitan areas. We are as surprised and disappointed as many of our readers have been, as well as puzzled. How can a country that has prided itself on its entrepreneurial activities, especially over the period we have analyzed, suffered such a steady erosion in the share of its firms that are truly entrepreneurial? We don’t yet have all the answers, though we hope to begin contributing a few in several weeks.\n",
      " \n",
      "In the meantime, we’ve been digging into the data for one of the sectors of the U.S. economy – the life sciences industry – to see if there are any more encouraging patterns. We focused on this sector, and in particular its startups, because it historically has been a driver of innovation in human health care and has played an outsized role in new job creation economy-wide.\n",
      " \n",
      "Although we didn’t have data for life sciences going all the way back to 1980, the start date for our earlier studies, we were able to examine the industry for the two decade period, 1990-2011. The evidence, it turns out, is mixed, and can be found in our detailed study published earlier this month at Brookings. Here are some of the highlights.\n",
      " \n",
      "First, the bad news. Overall, the life sciences industry experienced a relative 23 percent decline in startups and subsequent job creation over this period, significantly higher than the 15 percent decline across the economy as a whole.\n",
      " \n",
      "Some more bad news. There has been significant variation across three key life sciences industries, although all were hit hard in the Great Recession. The medical devices and equipment sector saw a steady and persistent decline in entrepreneurship and net job creation, with firm formations down more than 50 percent over the period we studied. Moreover, those firms that were born created fewer jobs over time. The medical devices segment represented about one out of every two new life sciences firms in 1990, but fell to one in three two decades later – a remarkable decline that was both steep and fell from was a large base, dragging down entrepreneurship rates in the life sciences sector overall.\n",

      "Here’s the good news, however. The drugs and pharmaceuticals sector has been particularly dynamic, with over 50 percent growth in new firm formation levels by 2011. Further, while the other groups (devices and labs) saw new firm formation rates fall during the 21-year period, drugs and pharmaceuticals increased by one-tenth of a percentage point. This increase admittedly is small, but against the huge drop nationwide among all types of firms, and the especially larger drop among medical device firms, we view this increase as welcome.\n",
      " \n",
      "Finally, while the level of new research, labs, and medical testing firms grew 38 percent between 1990 and 2007, these activities were hit hard by the Great Recession. Growth contracted after 2008, and by 2011 growth was just 4 percent higher than in 1990.\n",
      " \n",
      "The impact of this decline in number of new firms holds implications for the economy as a whole. The decline in the net job creation rate of life sciences startups overall appears to be about the same as for the rest of the economy, but despite the overall decline, the life sciences sector demonstrated a higher net job creation rate among startups relative to the rest of the private sector. In fact, life sciences startups were key drivers of job creation in the sector during the period of 1990 to 2011, whereas the effect of job creation and destruction among medium and mature firms mostly canceled each other out. The same is not the case for the private sector as a whole, where medium and mature aged firms are large net job destroyers.\n",

      "It is rare to talk to federal administrators and not hear something about “data-driven decision making.” Administrators dedicate significant time and information technology resources to decisions about their agency’s viability and to defending their standing in appropriations discussions. However, the questions asked of the data by senior officials for these purposes are dramatically different than the questions asked by a front line case manager for a social service organization.  Unfortunately, it is the former that has the loudest voice in procurement and system design conversations.  The prevailing top-down approach to data collection and use also puts little actionable information in the hands of the people responsible for gathering data. As a result, the incentive to collect data is diminished while opportunities for informed program improvements and abilities to measure outcomes against costs are missed. A small shift in our approach to data collection and visualization could lead to big improvements in the effectiveness of social service delivery.\n",
      "While the effort to collect and analyze data gives the impression of transparency, we are actually looking at our institutions through a fun house mirror. Frameworks are geared toward only answering a small set of high-level questions, creating a false sense of openness that limits the policy discourse around those agencies to their funding—not their effectiveness. \n",
      "It is time for this “good on the surface” notion to die, and in its place we must re-orient our data collection strategies to inform our work as it happens. \n",
      "Make no mistake—for the vast majority of agencies this is a wholesale paradigm shift with significant implications for design, implementation, and evaluation of social service delivery.\n",
      "Collecting the wrong data\n",
      "Take the case of homelessness organizations. Social workers across the country bring homeless families into a network of wrap-around services available through several state and local agencies. With every meeting, they collect qualitative and quantitative data about clients and update the case management system that loosely connects to that network of providers. If effectively analyzed and visualized, this information would likely help spot warning signs of future trouble for the family and would give social workers a chance to make a meaningful early intervention.  Visualizing the data could also inform the network of providers of interventions that are working so they can put resources to the most effective programs.\n",
      "However, the data entered in the system is often not used to produce the types of insights needed to help best manage cases. Instead, the data is sent to analysts at The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) who, once a year, release large, static reports including the Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR), Annual Progress Report (APR), and HEARTH Performance Measures. HUD has strict guidelines and complex coding systems for how data can be entered, stored, and used by community service providers. The mandated once-yearly reports are the primary form of feedback case managers receive from the information they’ve entered and contain very little useful information for day-to-day client service. \n",
      "Where this backward looking systemic analysis is valued is among the policymakers making budgetary decisions. Forensic analysis of program effectiveness is usually measured along broad performance indicators like individuals served, cost-per-beneficiary, number of people who have exited from system dependence. But these reactive measures do very little to help social workers ensure that client families make progress and don’t slide back into poverty. Without that direct connection to their work, it is inevitable that data collection and analysis becomes an infrequent and low-value administrative task on top of an already large workload.\n",
      "Shifting mentalities\n",
      "As Andrew Means describes it, we need to “upgrade from an output mentality to an input plus output mentality” when it comes to using data in this context. Means, the founder of Data Analysts for Social Good and The Impact Lab, works with organizations to update data collection techniques and use data science to solve longstanding social problems. He argues that too many public institutions view data exclusively an output of a program to show whether or not the original design was effective. \n",

      "\n",
      "Instead, Means advocates for primarily viewing data as an input—information that establishes a baseline of understanding and makes predictive modeling possible alongside forensic analysis. He has seen how individuals who see a far greater value in the data are more likely collect data faithfully and accurately. Better data leads to better analysis helping inform programs, making more targeted, efficient, and effective program work is possible. \n",
      "Drawing on our previous example, using data as an input allows agencies to estimate which beneficiaries are most likely to drop out of a homeless support program or which program they would be best served by. This is clearly in an agency’s best interest. Not only is the agency able to focus human and financial resources where they are most effective, but overall improvements in outcomes will reflect positively in conventional budgetary discussions. \n",
      "Higher value data = better transparency\n",
      "This brings us back to the question of transparency and value. Data that is not valued is not rigorously collected or validated. Moreover, because the analysis is only interesting to a small group of administrators, reporting is an afterthought. That is why agencies often dump a 25 column, comma-delimited file with 10,000 rows of data on their website and assume they are meeting their disclosure obligations. This information is virtually inaccessible to the average person in that form. It exists to validate past decisions instead of informing future ones, and the by-product of that approach is a policy discourse that cannot leverage data to advance our service delivery beyond the status quo. \n",
      "For social workers, agency directors, and funders, the challenge is not to simply make the data available but to make it useful for everyone in the decision chain. By using contextual resources like data visualization, individuals are empowered to act and ask more, better questions of the data. For a social worker, this could be an opportunity to use data in their work with individuals or to coordinate with partners who provide additional services to clients. Further upstream, institutions have an opportunity to articulate their value, showcase their progress, and advocate for a broader understanding of issues critical to their work. \n",
      "Not only will this increase public understanding of key issues, but also increase the accountability of agencies and decision makers to their constituencies to the benefit of our broader society.\n",
      "By taking a grassroots approach to data system design, we can put analytical power back into the hands of the people who can most effectively use it for change. For example, the Community Technology Alliance partnered with our organization to put the HUD data discussed above into a series of interactive reports that will help homelessness agencies nationwide and give them an opportunity to combine that data with their proprietary data to draw out more valuable insights. Modeled as a nationwide Data Fellowship, the program trains a group of 20 homeless services data enthusiasts across the country on analytical tools and visualization best practices. In addition to building a first set of field-usable visualizations, the fellows will also train their peers on the value of collecting and using data in their work.\n",
      "This is not just an effort to tackle homelessness and create change within one social service organization’s reporting system. It is an effort to create a new standard for information utility and transparency that all organizations can follow based on a few simple principles:\n",
      "\n",
      "Data must be useful to those responsible for collecting it and acting on it.\n",
      "More useful data for local decision-makers means better data for federal and state funding agencies as well as taxpaying citizens\n",
      "Data and the story it tells must be accessible and easily understood at all levels\n",
      "\n",
      "This is our challenge to government information technology leaders—let the old output-only notion of data driven decision making die. Build systems from where the information is most valuable, easily understood, and actionable and let them yield better data. Encourage transparent institutions using better data, and enrich the public discussion about an agency’s value to society. \n",
